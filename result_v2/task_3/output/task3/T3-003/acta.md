The prognosis is influenced by several documented factors. The surgical pathology report indicates a Gleason 3+3 (ISUP grade group 1) and pT2c stage with no extraprostatic extension, but positive surgical margins. The seminal vesicles were not invaded, and lymphovascular invasion was absent. A key uncertainty is the lack of documented nodal status, as no lymph nodes were removed, and missing nodal sampling widens this uncertainty. Preoperative PSA was 4.

Countervailing findings include the absence of lymphovascular invasion and seminal vesicle invasion. The difference between the biopsy and prostatectomy findings is noted as missing, which affects the certainty of the final pathological assessment. The postoperative PSA and its subsequent trajectory are critical missing pieces of information that would significantly revise this prognosis. The current horizon suggests a follow-up period within the heuristic sensitivity range. The fixed estimated horizon is 51.16 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 30.70–71.63 months; its coverage has not been validated.
