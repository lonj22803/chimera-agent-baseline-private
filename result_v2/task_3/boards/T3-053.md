The prognosis is favorable based on the surgical findings. Key positive factors include negative surgical margins, absence of seminal vesicle invasion, and no lymph node metastasis documented post-prostatectomy. The preoperative PSA was 4.8. The surgical specimen demonstrated a Gleason 4+4 (ISUP grade group 4), which is a significant factor. Countervailing findings include the preoperative PSA level and the documented Gleason score. The nodal status was negative, which is reassuring. The biopsy finding of a cribriform pattern and intraductal carcinoma was noted. Missing postoperative PSA or follow-up data currently widens the uncertainty regarding the trajectory of the disease. Information regarding postoperative PSA levels and subsequent changes would be crucial in refining the prognosis. The fixed estimated horizon is 38.32 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 30.66–45.99 months; its coverage has not been validated.
