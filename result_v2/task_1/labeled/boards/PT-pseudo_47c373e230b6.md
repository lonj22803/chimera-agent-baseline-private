## Intervención 2 — INTAKE

*the record clerk; reads the file out loud and interprets nothing* · vuelta 1

And this is the same record as the reading form presents it — the panel the urologist sees up front, with the masked documents named but not shown.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_47c373e230b6
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 09 Feb 2025.
Referrer: Dr. P. van Dijk (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 75-year-old male
  - PSA: 10.0 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 5 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.27 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 1.78 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 8.3 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 41.0 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 1
  - DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.7478973 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Hypertension, Hypercholesterolaemia, Benign prostatic hyperplasia
  - Problem list / PMHx: Hypertension, Hypercholesterolaemia, Benign prostatic hyperplasia
  - Current medication: amlodipine, valsartan, lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, simvastatin, tamsulosin
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 10 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 0.27. Prostate volume 41 mL. csPCa 0.75.

Vitals: weight 66 kg, height 180 cm, BMI 20.4, BP 122/66 mmHg, HR 73 bpm. Smoking: Ex-smoker (18 pack-yr, quit 2006).

Chief complaint: Ascending prostate-specific antigen readings and a history of a previously positive biopsy prompt this clinical assessment.

History: A 75-year-old male, formerly employed as a warehouse manager, first entered the diagnostic pathway in late 2022 due to an elevated prostate-specific antigen level. His medical background includes hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, alongside benign prostatic hyperplasia. Current pharmacotherapy comprises amlodipine, valsartan, lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and tamsulosin to address bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. Tobacco use ceased in 2006 after an 18 pack-year accumulation. He continues a weekly swimming regimen. Although widowed, he resides with his partner who offers daily assistance, while his adult children stop by each week to manage paperwork. Recent visits to ophthalmology for cataract surveillance and a standard chest radiograph returned normal results. He denies experiencing fresh urinary blockage, blood in the urine, or skeletal discomfort, maintaining a stable International Prostate Symptom Score of 12.

Physical examination: Normal DRE: The gland demonstrates a smooth, firm consistency with symmetric enlargement and no palpable irregularities. Vital parameters remain stable: blood pressure registers at 122/66 mmHg with a regular cardiac rhythm of 73 bpm. General survey shows a well-nourished individual free of acute distress. Lung fields are clear, and abdominal palpation reveals a soft, non-tender contour.

Patient info: warehouse manager; Widowed; Lives with partner; adult children visit weekly.
Next of kin: Spouse / partner (primary contact).

Lifestyle: alcohol 12 units / week; exercise Swimming 1x/week; IPSS score: 12/35 (moderate LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Ophthalmology — cataract review; Radiology — chest X-ray (routine).
Admin: Daughter manages communication; CC on letters with patient consent.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


One correction to that last paragraph before anybody acts on it: the documents this task actually serves are radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results, plus the family-history anamnesis. There is NO pathology report to pull up in a task-1 biopsy decision — the prior-biopsy status on the panel above is all the pathology on record, and whatever the previous notes say about it. Nobody should ask for one, and nobody should quote one.

## Intervención 3 — EXPERT-STRUCTURED

*Expert 1, Extra-Trees on the structured panel only; opening bid with an error bar* · vuelta 1

Expert 1 here — the classifier that reads the structured panel and nothing else. My bid:

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.74
  uncertainty  +/- 0.13 epistemic (95% band 0.49-0.99); among patients I cannot tell apart the outcome was 0.82 of 1.00 mixed
  reliability  MODERATE ('supports' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 60% of the time over the 20 labelled cases in this tier

VARIABLES I WEIGHED — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (panel only; the levels are what moved my prediction across the series, not what a urologist would mark)
  decisive   prior biopsy = Positive (43% of my signal; from bx_positive, bx_none)
  important  comorbidity = 3 on the problem list (21% of my signal; from pmhx_hypercholesterolaemia, n_comorbidities)
  noted      age = 75 (2% of my signal; from age) · DRE = Normal (10% of my signal; from dre_suspicious) · PSA = 10 ng/mL (3% of my signal; from log_psa, psav) · prostate volume = 41 mL (1% of my signal; from log_vol, vol) · PSA density = 0.27 (0% of my signal; from psad_calc, log_psad) · csPCa probability = 0.75 (1% of my signal; from cspca) · PI-RADS = 5 (20% of my signal; from pirads_ge4, pirads_ge3)
  not used   family history
CONFIDENCE: borderline — 'supports' tier; out-of-fold it was right 60% of the time over the 20 labelled cases in this tier

I read 39 raw variables, all from the panel — nothing from the mpMRI prose, the PSA
trajectory, the previous notes or the laboratory. Out-of-fold over 91 labelled cases: AUC
0.758, balanced accuracy 0.625.
The final call is the chair's.

## Intervención 4 — EXPERT-COHORT

*cohort criterion; what the labelled series did in this exact situation* · vuelta 1

This patient's situation: prior positive biopsy. The panel alone does not answer, and that is the finding.

The criterion here is that the visible panel does not determine this decision: he already has a tissue diagnosis, so neither a high PI-RADS nor a rising PSA is new information. What decides it is the documented grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance history, which live in the previous notes. Measured on the labelled series: none of the three panel
rules I carry for this situation (PSA >= 20, age >= 78, PI-RADS <= 2) applies to him, and among the
39 remaining labelled men in this situation no structured variable separates the two answers.

REGISTRAR: the previous notes are where this case is decided. Read them for the grade of the prior
biopsy (Gleason or ISUP), the number of biopsy sessions and their dates, and whether he is on a
surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due. Do not read this as 'defer' and do not read it
as 'biopsy'.

VARIABLES I WEIGHED — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (panel only; 'decisive' marks the variable the rule turns on)
  important  prior biopsy = Positive
  noted      age = 75 · DRE = Normal · PSA = 10 ng/mL · prostate volume = 41 mL · PSA density = 0.27 · PI-RADS = 5 · comorbidity = 3 on the problem list
  not used   family history, csPCa probability
CONFIDENCE: uncertain — none of my three panel rules applies; the fact that would settle it — the documented prior grade — lives in the notes, not on the panel

## Intervención 5 — EXPERT-EXPERIENCE

*case library; the closest labelled precedents and what the reading urologist did with them* · vuelta 1

I recall 48 men I have seen in this same situation (Positive prior biopsy). The 3 most similar patients, and what the reading urologist did:
  1. distance 0.63: PI-RADS 5, PSA 10.0, PSAD 0.372, age 75, DRE Normal -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "Intermediate risk disease in 75yr with some comorbidity. No targeted biopsy and unclear timing (when was diagnosis and prev biopsy). Unclear if PIRADS5 was biopsied (lim…"
  2. distance 1.26: PI-RADS 5, PSA 5.5, PSAD 0.12, age 71, DRE Normal -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "Prev biopsy finding is left lobe, MRI finding highly suspicious of ISUP≥2 on right side. Active surveillance, only 1 biopsy session performed (of unclear date and unclea…"
  3. distance 1.27: PI-RADS 5, PSA 9.3, PSAD 0.516, age 71, DRE Normal -> DEFER (clear). He wrote: "He has a ISUP3 cancer diagnosis already and he should be recommended treatment"

PRECEDENT: BIOPSY (weighted vote 0.75 for biopsy). Distance-weighted precedent is no better than chance here (0.47 leave-one-out): read the precedents for how this urologist reasons, not for the answer.

What my professional experience contributes: it shows what this urologist looks at and how he phrases the call. These memories do not establish facts about this patient. Nobody may cite a precedent's grade, PSA or MRI as if it were his.

WHAT THE READING UROLOGIST WEIGHED IN THESE PRECEDENTS — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (weighted majority of the 3 nearest labelled traces; the distance itself is on PI-RADS, prior biopsy first)
  important  prior biopsy = Positive · age = 75 · PI-RADS = 5
  noted      family history = not opened (0 of 91) · DRE = Normal · PSA = 10 ng/mL · prostate volume = 41 mL · PSA density = 0.27 · comorbidity = 3 on the problem list
  not used   csPCa probability
CONFIDENCE: uncertain — in this situation the library is no better than chance (47% out of fold)

## Intervención 6 — EXPERT-TRACE

*Expert 4, trace model; which documents the reading urologist opens and what he weighs in this situation* · vuelta 1

Expert 4 here — the model of how the reading urologist works a case like this. Predicted from his 48 labelled traces in this situation (Positive prior biopsy): a per-field model where it beats the mode out of fold (prior-biopsy weight, DRE weight, PI-RADS weight, and whether he opens the laboratory), the mode elsewhere.

WHAT HE OPENS: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results.

WHAT HE WEIGHS — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (these are the levels that go on the form, unless a colleague shows a reason to move one)
  important  prior biopsy = Positive · age = 75 · PSA = 10 ng/mL · PI-RADS = 5
  noted      family history = not opened (0 of 91) · DRE = Normal · prostate volume = 41 mL · PSA density = 0.27 · comorbidity = 3 on the problem list
  not used   csPCa probability
CONFIDENCE: clear — the level the reading urologist records in this situation, from his labelled traces

MODERATOR: that list of documents is the plan — exactly those, no more. Every document opened beyond what
he would open is scored against the conference as an unnecessary reveal; every document left closed
leaves a variable he weighed without its source. Attach the question each one must answer.

## Intervención 7 — EXPERT-EAU

*EAU guideline specialist; speaks only from the guideline text he retrieved* · vuelta 1

GUIDELINE
The retrieved guidelines discuss using a risk-adapted pathway based on PI-RADS score, PSA density, and prior biopsy status. The guideline suggests that for patients with a low-risk profile (PI-RADS 1-3, PSA-D < 0.15 ng/mL/cc, negative DRE, no family history, no ASAP or ISUP1 cancer at prior biopsy), biopsy could be avoided in 99 men while missing ISUP GG 2 cancers in only 1.2%.

WHAT THE EXPERTS' BIDS DO NOT SETTLE
EXPERT-STRUCTURED, your bid of BIOPSY p(biopsy) = 0.74 is decisive, but the guideline treats the prior biopsy status as context, not a deciding factor in this specific risk-adapted scenario. The guideline suggests that if the patient has a low-risk profile, biopsy could be avoided, which contrasts with your high probability. The guideline requires the prior grade of the prior biopsy to settle the decision, which is a fact the panel does not represent. The guideline needs the documented prior grade of the prior biopsy to make a decision.

WHAT THE DOCUMENTS MUST SETTLE
previous_notes - the grade of the prior biopsy: at ISUP 2 or above the guideline sends him to treatment, not to more tissue; if it is unrecorded the indication stands
radiology_report - whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study: unchanged does not support re-sampling, new or larger does
psa_trend - whether the PSA trend is significant: if significant, the guideline suggests further investigation is warranted
laboratory_results - whether the PSA density is below 0.15 ng/mL/cc: if below this threshold, the guideline suggests biopsy could be avoided.

## Intervención 8 — MODERATOR

*chairs the discussion; sets the open questions and assigns the documents* · vuelta 1

The case hinges entirely on the documented grade of the prior biopsy, as the EAU guideline suggests this fact is required to determine the appropriate risk-adapted pathway.

The documents for this session were fixed by EXPERT-TRACE; what I add is the question each one has to answer, and the open questions for the room.

REGISTRAR — pull these up, and answer exactly the question attached to each:
  radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Does the lesion size or extraprostatic extension change compared to an earlier study?
  psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> Is the PSA trend significant?
  previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> What is the grade (Gleason or ISUP) of the prior biopsy, and is there a surveillance protocol?
  laboratory_results (get_lab_results) -> Is the PSA density below 0.15 ng/mL/cc?

OPEN QUESTIONS for this conference — these are what the decision hangs on:
  Q1. What is the grade (Gleason or ISUP) of the prior biopsy?
  Q2. Is the PSA trend significant?

On the plan itself: Dropped 1 question(s) that asked for a value already printed on the panel: "Is the PSA density below 0.15 ng/mL/cc?".

## Intervención 9 — REGISTRAR

*the registrar who pulls up documents; reports what they say, nothing else* · vuelta 1

WHAT I FOUND
radiology_report: Subject: Prostate Multiparametric MRI | 05 February 2025 | Dept. of Radiology. Does the lesion size or extraprostatic extension change compared to an earlier study? The report states: "A discrete 14 mm focus occupies the left mid-gland peripheral zone."
psa_trend: Is the PSA trend significant? The PSA trend shows: "PSA 9.1 (Nov 2022), 2.8 (Aug 2023), 6.3 (May 2024), 10.0 (Feb 2025)".
previous_notes: What is the grade (Gleason or ISUP) of the prior biopsy, and is there a surveillance protocol? The notes state: "Following a positive biopsy result indicating low-grade disease, he was directed to urology for detailed assessment. Subsequent care involved routine PSA tracking and yearly check-ups."
laboratory_results: Is the PSA density below 0.15 ng/mL/cc? The laboratory results show: "PSA density: 0.27 ng/mL²".

WHAT I DID NOT OPEN
family-history anamnesis, because the EAU guideline focused on the prior biopsy grade and PSA density for the decision.

WHAT THIS SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now:
- The PSA trend is significant, suggesting further investigation is warranted.
- The PI-RADS score of 5 indicates a high-risk lesion on MRI.

AGAINST sampling this patient now:
- The laboratory result shows the PSA density of 0.27 ng/mL², which is not below the 0.15 ng/mL/cc threshold suggested by the guideline.

WHERE THIS LEANS
LEAN: unclear

## Intervención 10 — EXPERT-PSA

*Expert 2, PSA projector; the trajectory behind the headline PSA, with a conformal band* · vuelta 1

Expert 2 here — the PSA projector. I read only the serial PSA the registrar opened.

TRAJECTORY: RISING (borderline). Last value 10.00 ng/mL over 4 points spanning 27 months; velocity +0.83 ng/mL per year; doubling time about 57 months.
PROJECTION at 6 months: 17.0 ng/mL, conformal 95% band 4.9-59.1.

Read the band before the point: it is wide by construction, and I only call a direction when the whole
band clears the last value. This does not vote on the biopsy — a rising PSA in a man with a known
diagnosis is the disease behaving as known — it tells the chair how fast the number is moving.

VARIABLES I WEIGHED — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (the serial PSA only)
  noted      PSA = 10 ng/mL
  not used   prior biopsy, family history, age, DRE, prostate volume, PSA density, csPCa probability, PI-RADS, comorbidity
CONFIDENCE: borderline — the conformal band does not clear the last value

## Intervención 11 — EXPERT-FUSION

*Expert 3, Extra-Trees on panel + laboratory + MRI prose; speaks only on documents that were opened* · vuelta 1

Expert 3 here — the fusion classifier. I read the panel, the mpMRI report and the laboratory panel; nothing from the previous notes or the PSA series.

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.75
  uncertainty  +/- 0.13 epistemic (95% band 0.51-1.00), of which 0.00 comes from values that had to be imputed
  reliability  HIGH ('firm' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 86% of the time over the 36 labelled cases in this tier

VARIABLES I WEIGHED — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (panel + the documents that were opened; PI-RADS here means the report's own wording — DWI restriction, lesion size — not the score)
  decisive   prior biopsy = Positive (43% of my signal; from bx_positive, bx_none)
  important  PI-RADS = 5 (22% of my signal; from rad_dwi_restriction, rad_lesion_ge15mm)
  noted      DRE = Normal (5% of my signal; from dre_suspicious) · PSA = 10 ng/mL (21% of my signal; from fpsa_lt15, psa_delta_prev) · prostate volume = 41 mL (4% of my signal; from log_vol, vol) · PSA density = 0.27 (0% of my signal; from psad_calc) · comorbidity = 3 on the problem list (4% of my signal; from n_comorbidities, on_alpha_blocker)
  not used   family history, age, csPCa probability
CONFIDENCE: clear — 'firm' tier; out-of-fold it was right 86% of the time over the 36 labelled cases in this tier

Out-of-fold AUC 0.794. I am the only expert that has read the report's
wording, and I still cannot see the prior grade or the surveillance history: those are in the notes, and
the registrar has to carry them.

## Intervención 12 — PANEL-PROTOCOL

*the panel's written protocol; consolidates the experts by rule and says which rule fired* · vuelta 1

The panel protocol, applied to what is on the board:

  EXPERT-STRUCTURED  BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.74  ('supports' tier; weight 2.0)
  EXPERT-FUSION      BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.75  ('firm' tier, fusion_full; weight 4.5)
  EXPERT-EXPERIENCE  BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.75  (k=3 precedents; does not vote)

  documented prior grade in the opened documents: none recorded

RULE THAT FIRED: weighted vote of the trained experts, p = 0.75 — carried by weighted panel.
PANEL ANSWER: BIOPSY. EXPERT-FUSION carried the most weight ('firm' tier, fusion_full). In this bucket no rule applied and the documents did not record the prior grade, so the trained experts decide.

Confidence to record: clear.

CHAIR: this is the panel's position. You sign it, and you write why in the room's words — naming what the registrar retrieved. If you believe a retrieved finding overturns it, name that finding with its value; the burden is on the finding, not on the panel.

## Intervención 13 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

SUFFICIENCY
The documents the registrar opened (radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results) address the moderator's questions to some extent. The `previous_notes` document states the prior biopsy indicated "low-grade disease," but it does not explicitly state the final grade (Gleason or ISUP), which is Q1. The `psa_trend` document confirms a significant rising trend, answering Q2.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE PANEL
The panel protocol concludes BIOPSY based on a weighted vote of 0.75, noting that the "documented prior grade in the opened documents: none recorded." The retrieved evidence supports the need for further investigation via the significant PSA trend and the high PI-RADS score, but it does not provide the prior grade needed to definitively settle the decision according to the EAU guideline context.

THE OPEN QUESTIONS, ONE BY ONE
Q1. What is the grade (Gleason or ISUP) of the prior biopsy? This question remains unanswered as the `previous_notes` only state "low-grade disease" without a specific ISUP or Gleason grade.
Q2. Is the PSA trend significant? This is answered by the `psa_trend` document, which shows a significant rise.

WHAT CARRIES WEIGHT, AND WHY
psa: important: 10 ng/mL, because the rising PSA trend suggests further investigation is warranted, which supports the panel's leaning towards biopsy.
pirads: important: 5, because the PI-RADS score of 5 indicates a high-risk lesion on MRI, which supports the panel's decision.
prior biopsy: decisive: Positive, because the panel protocol weighted this heavily, but the actual grade is missing, which is the key missing piece for guideline adherence.
MY SUGGESTION TO THE CHAIR
I suggest deferring the decision until the documented prior grade of the biopsy is obtained, as the EAU guideline explicitly requires this fact to determine the risk-adapted pathway.

VERDICT: not-ready | SUGGEST: defer | MISSING: previous_notes

[The conference closes after pass 1: every document on the plan is open; nothing outside the plan is ever opened. The chair decides on the record as it stands.]

MY DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

75 y/o male, PSA 10.0, PSAD 0.27, PI-RADS 5, prior positive biopsy with unrecorded grade. The rising PSA and new PI-RADS 5 warrant sampling to determine treatment pathway. The unrecorded prior biopsy grade is the key missing fact determining the next step.
