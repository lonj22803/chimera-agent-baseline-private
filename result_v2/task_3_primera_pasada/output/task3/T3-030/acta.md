## Intervención 10 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

{"ready": true, "missing_documents": [], "ln_unknown": true, "limitations": "Numerically ready; postoperative PSA trajectory and follow-up may be absent. Sensitivity range is heuristic; no confidence calibration is validated.", "nodal_status": "No nodes sampled; pNx is not pN0."}

## Intervención 11 — CHAIR

*the senior urologist who signs the decision* · vuelta 1

Postoperative prognosis depends on the preoperative PSA and the prostatectomy findings. Extraprostatic extension is reported absent. Positive surgical margins is documented. Seminal vesicle invasion is reported absent. Lymphovascular invasion is reported absent. No lymph nodes were sampled; pNx does not establish node-negative disease and widens uncertainty. Postoperative PSA and its subsequent trajectory are needed to refine this prognosis; a future recurrence date cannot be established from surgical risk factors alone. The fixed estimated horizon is 61.61 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 40.05–83.18 months; its coverage has not been validated.
