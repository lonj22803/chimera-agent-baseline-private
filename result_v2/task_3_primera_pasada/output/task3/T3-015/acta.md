The prognosis is influenced by several documented factors. The surgical findings are favorable, showing a pT2 stage with no extraprostatic extension, negative surgical margins, and no seminal vesicle invasion. The preoperative PSA was elevated at 11. A countervailing finding is the discrepancy between the preoperative biopsy, which showed Gleason 3+3, and the prostatectomy specimen, which was graded as Gleason 4+3 (ISUP grade group 4). Furthermore, no lymph nodes were removed, and nodal status is unknown due to missing sampling, which widens uncertainty.

The primary driver for recurrence risk is the higher pathological grade observed post-surgery compared to the biopsy. Information that would significantly revise this prognosis includes the postoperative PSA level and its subsequent trajectory. A documented postoperative PSA value and its trend would be crucial in assessing the risk profile. The current uncertainty is heightened by the lack of nodal sampling, as pNx does not equate to pN0. The fixed estimated horizon is 52.81 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 34.33–71.30 months; its coverage has not been validated.
