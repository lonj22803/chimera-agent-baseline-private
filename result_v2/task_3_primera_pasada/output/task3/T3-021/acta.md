The prognosis is influenced by several documented factors. The surgical findings included a Gleason 3+3 (ISUP grade group 1) and pathological stage pT2 with no extraprostatic extension and positive surgical margins. The seminal vesicles were not invaded, and lymphovascular invasion was absent. The absence of documented nodal sampling, resulting in a pNx status, widens the uncertainty regarding local disease control. The biopsy grade matched the prostatectomy specimen. Countervailing factors include the preoperative PSA of 6.9. The primary uncertainty lies in the postoperative PSA and its subsequent trajectory, as this information is missing. Missing nodal sampling further complicates the assessment of regional disease control. Information regarding postoperative PSA levels and trends would significantly revise this prognosis. The fixed estimated horizon is 81.76 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 53.14–110.37 months; its coverage has not been validated.
