I recall these other postoperative patients in the same CAPRA-S group. Each outcome belongs to another patient, not this patient. These observations cannot estimate this patient's survival or recurrence date.
Another patient, T3-061: CAPRA-S 4.0; observed censored follow-up without recurrence at 80.2 months. Do not copy this outcome into the current note.
Another patient, T3-069: CAPRA-S 4.0; observed censored follow-up without recurrence at 56.1 months. Do not copy this outcome into the current note.

The postoperative pathology reveals a Gleason 3+4 (ISUP grade group 2) and pathological T2 stage with no extraprostatic extension. A positive surgical margin is a significant adverse finding, contrasting with the absence of seminal vesicle invasion, which is noted as "not invaded." Lymph node metastasis was documented. The nodal status is noted as "lymph node metastasis was present." The preoperative PSA level was 5.8. The presence of lymph node metastasis is a factor driving concern. Countervailing findings include the absence of extraprostatic extension and no seminal vesicle invasion. The biopsy report is missing Gleason pattern and ISUP information, which widens uncertainty regarding the true tumor biology. Postoperative PSA is not recorded, meaning biochemical recurrence cannot be assessed. Information regarding postoperative PSA and its trajectory is essential to revise the prognosis. The fixed estimated horizon is 32.32 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 25.86–38.79 months; its coverage has not been validated.
