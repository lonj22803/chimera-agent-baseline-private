The postoperative pathology demonstrated a Gleason 3+4 (ISUP grade group 2) and pathological stage pT2. Reassuring findings include negative surgical margins, no invasion of the seminal vesicles, and absence of lymphovascular invasion. The biopsy identified Acinar adenocarcinoma. A significant factor influencing prognosis is the absence of documented nodal status, as "No lymph nodes were removed," which means "pNx is not pN0," widening the uncertainty regarding regional disease control. The surgical findings are favorable, with the report stating, "The robot-assisted radical prostatectomy specimen showed Gleason 3+4 (ISUP grade group 2), pathological stage pT2. There was no extraprostatic extension; surgical margins were negative; the seminal vesicles were not invaded; lymphovascular invasion was absent; no lymph nodes were removed." Countervailing findings are limited by the missing postoperative PSA, which is unknown, meaning biochemical recurrence cannot be assessed. Postoperative PSA and its trajectory are crucial information that would revise the prognosis. Missing nodal sampling widens uncertainty regarding the extent of disease. The fixed estimated horizon is 77.93 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 50.65–105.21 months; its coverage has not been validated.
