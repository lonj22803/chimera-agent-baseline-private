I recall these other postoperative patients in the same CAPRA-S group. Each outcome belongs to another patient, not this patient. These observations cannot estimate this patient's survival or recurrence date.
Another patient, T3-045: CAPRA-S 4.0; observed censored follow-up without recurrence at 24.2 months. Do not copy this outcome into the current note.
Another patient, T3-024: CAPRA-S 4.0; observed censored follow-up without recurrence at 60.6 months. Do not copy this outcome into the current note.
Another patient, T3-015: CAPRA-S 4.0; observed censored follow-up without recurrence at 47.1 months. Do not copy this outcome into the current note.

Postoperative prognosis depends on the preoperative PSA and the prostatectomy findings. Extraprostatic extension is reported absent. Positive surgical margins is reported absent. Seminal vesicle invasion is reported absent. Lymphovascular invasion is reported absent. Postoperative PSA and its subsequent trajectory are needed to refine this prognosis; a future recurrence date cannot be established from surgical risk factors alone. The fixed estimated horizon is 62.29 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 46.72–77.86 months; its coverage has not been validated.
