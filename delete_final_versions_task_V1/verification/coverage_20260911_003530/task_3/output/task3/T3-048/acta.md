The prognosis is influenced by several documented factors. Preoperative PSA was elevated at 6.9. The surgical findings indicate a Gleason 3+4 (ISUP grade group 2) and pathological T3a stage with extraprostatic extension, but negative surgical margins and no seminal vesicle invasion are favorable. The absence of lymphovascular invasion is also a positive finding.

Countervailing factors include the absence of lymph node removal, resulting in a pNx status, which widens uncertainty regarding nodal status. The biopsy showed a Gleason 3+4 diagnosis, which aligns with the resection, though the biopsy did not identify cribriform or intraductal carcinoma.

The primary uncertainty lies in the missing postoperative PSA and follow-up data, which significantly impacts the trajectory prediction. Information regarding postoperative PSA levels and subsequent changes would be crucial to refine this prognosis. The current heuristic horizon suggests a range for recurrence risk. The fixed estimated horizon is 69.39 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 45.11–93.68 months; its coverage has not been validated.
