The postoperative prognosis is favorable based on the documented surgical findings. Key positive factors include a negative surgical margin, absence of extraprostatic extension, non-invasion of the seminal vesicles, and no lymph node metastasis reported. The preoperative PSA was 4.3. The surgical pathology reported a Gleason 3+4 (ISUP grade group 2) and pathological T2 stage. Countervailing findings include the missing Gleason pattern and ISUP report from the single biopsy session, which widens uncertainty regarding the true tumor biology. Nodal status was documented as negative. The prognosis is further complicated by the absence of postoperative PSA or follow-up data, which is critical for trajectory assessment. Information regarding postoperative PSA levels and its subsequent trajectory would significantly revise this prognosis. The fixed estimated horizon is 84.76 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 67.81–101.71 months; its coverage has not been validated.
