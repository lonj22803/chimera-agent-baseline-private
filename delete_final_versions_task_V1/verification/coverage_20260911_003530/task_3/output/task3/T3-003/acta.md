The postoperative prognosis is influenced by several documented factors. The surgical findings indicate a Gleason 3+3 (ISUP grade group 1) and pathological stage pT2c with no extraprostatic extension. Positive surgical margins were noted, but the seminal vesicles were not invaded, and lymphovascular invasion was absent. A significant uncertainty arises from the nodal status, as "no lymph nodes were removed," and nodal sampling was not performed, which widens the uncertainty regarding potential nodal involvement. Preoperative PSA was 4.

Countervailing findings include the absence of lymphovascular invasion and the absence of documented recurrence. However, the lack of documented nodal sampling means that the status is pNx, which is not equivalent to pN0. The biopsy-to-prostatectomy difference is noted as the Gleason pattern and ISUP report are missing from the pathology report. Information that would revise this prognosis, particularly the postoperative PSA and its trajectory, would be crucial. The current uncertainty regarding nodal status and the missing previous notes limit definitive assessment. The fixed estimated horizon is 76.69 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 46.02–107.37 months; its coverage has not been validated.
