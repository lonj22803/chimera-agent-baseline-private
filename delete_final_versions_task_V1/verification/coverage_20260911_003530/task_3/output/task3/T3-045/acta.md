The prognosis following radical prostatectomy is influenced by several documented factors. Favorable findings include a negative surgical margin, absence of seminal vesicle invasion, and absence of lymphovascular invasion. The preoperative PSA was elevated at 18. The surgical pathology reported a Gleason 4+3 (ISUP grade group 3) and pathological T2 stage with no extraprostatic extension. Countervailing factors include the absence of lymph node removal, resulting in an uncharacterized nodal status, which widens uncertainty. Furthermore, the biopsy report lacks a Gleason pattern and ISUP grade, creating a discrepancy with the final resection specimen. The lack of postoperative PSA data or follow-up information significantly limits the ability to track recurrence. Information regarding postoperative PSA levels and its subsequent trajectory would be crucial for refining this prognosis. The current uncertainty is compounded by the missing nodal sampling, as pNx does not equate to pN0. The fixed estimated horizon is 62.79 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 40.81–84.77 months; its coverage has not been validated.
