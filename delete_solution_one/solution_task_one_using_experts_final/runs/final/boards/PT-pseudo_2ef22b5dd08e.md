## Intervención 2 — INTAKE

*the record clerk; reads the file out loud and interprets nothing* · vuelta 1

And this is the same record as the reading form presents it — the panel the urologist sees up front, with the masked documents named but not shown.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_2ef22b5dd08e
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 18 Feb 2025.
Referrer: Dr. C. Peters (GP).
Type: Follow-up - PSA + MRI.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 66-year-old male
  - PSA: 9.3 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 4 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.296 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 1.34 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 6.2 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 31.46 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 2
  - DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: None (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.8335312 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Not reported
  - Problem list / PMHx: none recorded
  - Current medication: None
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 9.3 ng/mL. PI-RADS 4. PSAD 0.30. Prostate volume 31 mL. csPCa 0.83.

Vitals: weight 75 kg, height 184 cm, BMI 22.2, BP 136/76 mmHg, HR 71 bpm. Smoking: Ex-smoker (24 pack-yr, quit 2020).

Chief complaint: Clinical reassessment indicated due to a persistent upward PSA trajectory coupled with recent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging results.

History: At 66 years of age, this semi-retired harbour pilot seeks review concerning his prostate-specific antigen trajectory, accompanied by a longstanding record of moderate lower urinary tract symptoms (IPSS 8/35). He shares an assisted-living residence with his spouse, who serves as his main point of contact. Physical activity remains a priority, featuring three weekly cycling sessions covering roughly 30 km each, balanced with an alcohol intake of 8 units weekly. His smoking history totals 24 pack-years, though he ceased tobacco use in 2020. Ocular limitations necessitate large-print documents. Recent medical engagements include a gastroenterology visit for standard colonoscopy screening, pulmonary function testing, and a baseline chest radiograph. A laparoscopic gallbladder removal occurred in 2015, entirely separate from his present urological evaluation. He maintains no active comorbidities, takes no prescribed medications, manages occasional seasonal allergies with non-prescription antihistamines, and carries no prior biopsy history. No unexplained weight reduction, skeletal discomfort, or blood in the urine has been reported. General health otherwise appears stable.

Physical examination: Per rectum: Normal DRE; digital assessment reveals a uniformly enlarged gland exhibiting consistent firmness without discrete irregularities or lateralised masses. Cardiovascular and respiratory auscultation demonstrate regular rhythms and clear field expansion. Abdominal percussion and palpation confirm a pliable, non-tender cavity lacking palpable hepatosplenomegaly or abnormal growths.

Patient info: harbour pilot (semi-retired); Married; Lives in assisted-living facility.
Next of kin: Spouse / partner (primary contact).

Lifestyle: alcohol 8 units / week; exercise Cycling 3x/week, ~30 km; IPSS score: 8/35 (moderate LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Gastroenterology — surveillance colonoscopy; Radiology — chest X-ray (routine); Pulmonary function test — known COPD follow-up.
Admin: Visual impairment: large-print correspondence requested.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


One correction to that last paragraph before anybody acts on it: the documents this task actually serves are radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results, plus the family-history anamnesis. There is NO pathology report to pull up in a task-1 biopsy decision — the prior-biopsy status on the panel above is all the pathology on record, and whatever the previous notes say about it. Nobody should ask for one, and nobody should quote one.

## Intervención 3 — EXPERT-STRUCTURED

*Expert 1, Extra-Trees on the structured panel only; opening bid with an error bar* · vuelta 1

Expert 1 here — the classifier that reads the structured panel and nothing else. My bid:

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.90
  uncertainty  +/- 0.05 epistemic (95% band 0.80-0.99); among patients I cannot tell apart the outcome was 0.48 of 1.00 mixed
  reliability  HIGH ('firm' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 88% of the time over the 33 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most, across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, PI-RADS >= 4, no prior biopsy, pmhx_hypercholesterolaemia, suspicious DRE, number of comorbidities. I read 39 variables, all
from the panel — nothing from the mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the
laboratory. Out-of-fold over 91 labelled cases: AUC 0.758, balanced
accuracy 0.625.

The final call is the chair's.

## Intervención 4 — EXPERT-COHORT

*cohort criterion; what the labelled series did in this exact situation* · vuelta 1

This patient's situation: never biopsied. My criterion answers BIOPSY.

The criterion: sample when the mpMRI shows a PI-RADS 3 or higher lesion; defer at PI-RADS 1-2. In the labelled series this criterion matched the reading urologist in 24 of 24 cases in exactly this situation.

Like Expert 1, I have read ONLY the visible panel — not the mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the
previous notes or the laboratory panel. Departing from me needs a specific finding from a document
somebody actually opened, named out loud; not a restatement of the panel numbers I already used.

## Intervención 5 — EXPERT-LIBRARY

*case library; the closest labelled precedents and what the reading urologist did with them* · vuelta 1

The case library holds 23 labelled men in this same situation (None prior biopsy). The 3 closest by panel distance, and what the reading urologist did:
  1. distance 1.49: PI-RADS 4, PSA 13.9, PSAD 0.177, age 65, DRE Normal -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "P4 in 65 year old patient"
  2. distance 1.83: PI-RADS NA, PSA 4.5, PSAD 0.095, age 67, DRE Normal -> DEFER (clear). He wrote: "Normal MRI. No biopsy"
  3. distance 1.87: PI-RADS 5, PSA 9.0, PSAD 0.409, age 65, DRE Normal -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "P5 in a man with high PSA"

PRECEDENT: BIOPSY (weighted vote 0.69 for biopsy). Distance-weighted precedent is strong here (0.92 leave-one-out).

What the precedents are FOR: they show what this urologist looks at and how he phrases the call. What they are NOT: facts about this patient. Nobody may cite a precedent's grade, PSA or MRI as if it were his.

## Intervención 6 — EXPERT-TRACE

*Expert 4, trace model; which documents the reading urologist opens and what he weighs in this situation* · vuelta 1

Expert 4 here — the model of how the reading urologist works a case like this. Predicted from his 23 labelled traces in this situation (None prior biopsy): a per-field model where it beats the mode out of fold (prior-biopsy weight, DRE weight, PI-RADS weight, and whether he opens the laboratory), the mode elsewhere.

WHAT HE OPENS: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes.
WHAT HE WEIGHS: bx=noted, fh=noted, age=important, dre=noted, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=decisive, comorbidity=noted.
HOW SURE HE USUALLY IS: clear.

MODERATOR: that list of documents is the plan — exactly those, no more. Every document opened beyond what
he would open is scored against the conference as an unnecessary reveal; every document left closed
leaves a variable he weighed without its source. Attach the question each one must answer.

## Intervención 7 — EXPERT-EAU

*EAU guideline specialist; speaks only from the guideline text he retrieved* · vuelta 1

GUIDELINE
The EAU guidelines suggest that a PI-RADS threshold of $\ge 3$ is used to trigger a biopsy. The guideline states, "a PI-RADS threshold of $\ge 3$ is used to trigger biopsy [135, 226, 264, 375], at the cost of missing a small number of mainly ISUP GG 2 cancers, especially in biopsy-naive patients or in highly selected populations with high prevalence of csPCa (in which the MRI NPV decreases) [372, 472]."

WHAT THE EXPERTS' BIDS DO NOT SETTLE
EXPERT-STRUCTURED, your suggestion of biopsy is contradicted by the guideline's focus on risk stratification, which implies that the decision must be made based on the PI-RADS score relative to the threshold. EXPERT-COHORT, your criterion, which mandates biopsy for PI-RADS 3 or higher, aligns with the guideline's general approach, but the guideline itself notes that this approach comes at the cost of missing some cancers.

WHAT THE DOCUMENTS MUST SETTLE
previous_notes - the prior-biopsy status: at None the guideline suggests that a PI-RADS $\ge 3$ mandates biopsy, regardless of prior biopsy status.
radiology_report - whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study: unchanged does not support re-sampling, new or larger does
psa_trend - the PSA velocity: the guideline does not explicitly state a threshold for PSA velocity, but the context suggests that the PI-RADS score is the primary driver for the biopsy decision.
laboratory_results - the PSA density: the guideline mentions that PSA-D is a significant predictor in risk-adapted matrices, suggesting it should be considered alongside PI-RADS.

## Intervención 8 — MODERATOR

*chairs the discussion; sets the open questions and assigns the documents* · vuelta 1

This case hinges on whether the PI-RADS 4 finding, combined with the guideline's threshold, mandates a biopsy, and what the previous notes reveal about the patient's history.

The documents for this session were fixed by EXPERT-TRACE; what I add is the question each one has to answer, and the open questions for the room.

REGISTRAR — pull these up, and answer exactly the question attached to each:
  radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Must state whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study.
  psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> Must indicate the PSA velocity.
  previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> Must detail the prior biopsy status, surveillance protocol, and planned treatment.

OPEN QUESTIONS for this conference — these are what the decision hangs on:
  Q1. What does the radiology_report state regarding whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study?
  Q2. What does the psa_trend indicate regarding the PSA velocity?
  Q3. What does the previous_notes state regarding the prior biopsy status, surveillance protocol, and planned treatment?

## Intervención 9 — REGISTRAR

*the registrar who pulls up documents; reports what they say, nothing else* · vuelta 1

WHAT I FOUND
radiology_report
COMPARISON: new
LESION: PI-RADS 4 lesion in the left peripheral zone (base-to-mid), 14 mm.

psa_trend
PSA velocity: The PSA trend shows a rise from 6.7 ng/mL (Jul 2022) to 9.3 ng/mL (Feb 2025).

previous_notes
PRIOR GRADE: not recorded
BIOPSY SESSIONS: None
SURVEILLANCE: not recorded
TREATMENT: none recorded

WHAT I DID NOT OPEN
laboratory_results, family-history anamnesis, and the mpMRI prose were not opened because the required information was already extracted from the opened documents or is not required for the immediate decision based on the moderator's questions.

WHAT THIS SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now
PI-RADS 4 finding supports biopsy as per the EXPERT-COHORT criterion.
PSA velocity indicates a significant upward trajectory, supporting the need for further investigation.

AGAINST sampling this patient now
Prior biopsy status is None, which is a factor considered by the EXPERT-LIBRARY.

WHERE THIS LEANS
LEAN: biopsy

## Intervención 10 — EXPERT-PSA

*Expert 2, PSA projector; the trajectory behind the headline PSA, with a conformal band* · vuelta 1

Expert 2 here — the PSA projector. I read only the serial PSA the registrar opened.

TRAJECTORY: RISING (borderline). Last value 9.30 ng/mL over 4 points spanning 31 months; velocity +0.94 ng/mL per year; doubling time about 67 months.
PROJECTION at 6 months: 14.6 ng/mL, conformal 95% band 4.2-50.8.

Read the band before the point: it is wide by construction, and I only call a direction when the whole
band clears the last value. This does not vote on the biopsy — a rising PSA in a man with a known
diagnosis is the disease behaving as known — it tells the chair how fast the number is moving.

## Intervención 11 — EXPERT-FUSION

*Expert 3, Extra-Trees on panel + laboratory + MRI prose; speaks only on documents that were opened* · vuelta 1

Expert 3 here — the fusion classifier. I read the panel, the mpMRI report — the laboratory panel was not opened, so that block is imputed and my band is wider for it; nothing from the previous notes or the PSA series.

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.85
  uncertainty  +/- 0.06 epistemic (95% band 0.74-0.96), of which 0.01 comes from values that had to be imputed
  reliability  HIGH ('firm' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 89% of the time over the 37 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, no prior biopsy, free PSA < 15%, DWI restriction in the report, lesion >= 15 mm in the report, suspicious DRE. Out-of-fold AUC 0.794. I am the only expert that has read the report's wording, and I still cannot see the prior grade or the
surveillance history: those are in the notes, and the registrar has to carry them.

## Intervención 12 — PANEL-PROTOCOL

*the panel's written protocol; consolidates the experts by rule and says which rule fired* · vuelta 1

The panel protocol, applied to what is on the board:

  EXPERT-STRUCTURED  BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.90  ('firm' tier; weight 3.0)
  EXPERT-FUSION      BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.85  ('firm' tier, fusion_nolab; weight 4.5)
  EXPERT-LIBRARY     BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.69  (k=3 precedents; does not vote)
  EXPERT-COHORT      BIOPSY  (rule pirads_ge_3; does not vote)

  documented prior grade in the opened documents: none recorded

RULE THAT FIRED: cohort criterion (pirads_ge_3) — carried by EXPERT-COHORT.
PANEL ANSWER: BIOPSY. It matched the reading urologist in 24 of 24 labelled cases in exactly this situation (never biopsied).

Confidence the trace model expects here: clear. Weights it expects: bx=noted, fh=noted, age=important, dre=noted, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=decisive, comorbidity=noted.

CHAIR: this is the panel's position. You sign it, and you write why in the room's words — naming what the registrar retrieved. If you believe a retrieved finding overturns it, name that finding with its value; the burden is on the finding, not on the panel.

## Intervención 13 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

SUFFICIENCY
The documents retrieved by the registrar—radiology_report, psa_trend, and previous_notes—directly address all three moderator questions.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE PANEL
The retrieved evidence supports the PANEL-PROTOCOL's answer of BIOPSY, as the PI-RADS 4 finding aligns with the EXPERT-COHORT criterion (PI-RADS $\ge 3$ mandates biopsy).

THE OPEN QUESTIONS, ONE BY ONE
Q1. The radiology_report states the comparison is "new."
Q2. The psa_trend indicates a PSA velocity of +0.94 ng/mL per year.
Q3. The previous_notes state the prior biopsy status is "None," surveillance protocol is "not recorded," and treatment is "none recorded."

WHAT CARRIES WEIGHT, AND WHY
The PI-RADS 4 finding is the most decisive variable as it directly triggers the cohort criterion, which is the rule that fired in the PANEL-PROTOCOL. The PSA velocity is also important as it indicates a significant upward trajectory.

MY SUGGESTION TO THE CHAIR
I suggest proceeding with a biopsy based on the PI-RADS 4 finding and the established guideline threshold, as this aligns with the panel's conclusion and the retrieved data.

VERDICT: ready | SUGGEST: biopsy | MISSING: none

[The conference closes after pass 1: the verifier called the record ready. The chair decides on the record as it stands.]

## Intervención 14 — CHAIR

*the senior urologist who signs the decision* · vuelta 1

MY DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

66y male, PSA 9.3, PSAD 0.296, biopsy-naive, PI-RADS 4 lesion in left peripheral zone. Biopsy indicated due to PI-RADS 4 and raised PSA density. No prior pathology to reconcile findings.

What carried weight: bx=noted, age=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=decisive, comorbidity=noted
Sections retrieved: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes
