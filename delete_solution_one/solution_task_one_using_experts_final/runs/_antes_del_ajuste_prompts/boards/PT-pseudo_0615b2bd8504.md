## Intervención 2 — INTAKE

*the record clerk; reads the file out loud and interprets nothing* · vuelta 1

And this is the same record as the reading form presents it — the panel the urologist sees up front, with the masked documents named but not shown.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_0615b2bd8504
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 26 Jan 2025.
Referrer: Dr. C. Peters (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 63-year-old male
  - PSA: 160.0 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 5 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 2.635 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 35.73 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 115.9 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 60.71 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 1
  - DRE findings: Abnormal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.95889634 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Not reported
  - Problem list / PMHx: none recorded
  - Current medication: None
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 160 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 2.63. Prostate volume 61 mL. DRE abnormal. csPCa 0.96.

Vitals: weight 93 kg, height 191 cm, BMI 25.5, BP 140/81 mmHg, HR 48 bpm. Smoking: Current smoker (20 pack-yr).

Chief complaint: Persistent elevation in PSA levels alongside a history of biopsy-confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma warrants clinical reassessment.

History: Now aged 63-year-old, the individual works as a retired bank clerk and Lives in ground-floor apartment with partner. Following an initial PSA measurement of 55.0 ng/mL in late 2022, a prior biopsy bucket "Positive" was documented. He maintains a Married status and engages in light resistance training twice weekly, complemented by a moderate alcohol intake of 14 units per week. Current smoker (20 pack-yr) status is noted, though he explicitly denies haematuria, pelvic discomfort, or lower urinary tract symptoms exceeding a baseline IPSS of 10. Past medical reviews include a routine hearing evaluation, an orthopaedic check for stable knee osteoarthritis, and a memory clinic assessment revealing intact cognition. He has never utilized 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. General health remains excellent with an ECOG performance status of 0. Comorbidities: none. Active medication: None.

Physical examination: DRE — texture: firm and irregular nodule palpable in the left posterior peripheral zone; mobility: fixed; asymmetry: pronounced enlargement with right lobe induration but no distinct discrete masses; overall classification: cT3a. Abnormal DRE confirmed. Vital signs record a blood pressure of 140/81 mmHg and a resting heart rate of 48 bpm. General survey shows no palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

Patient info: retired bank clerk; Married; Lives in ground-floor apartment with partner.
Next of kin: Sibling (brother).

Lifestyle: alcohol 14 units / week; exercise Light weight-training at home, 2x/week; IPSS score: 10/35 (moderate LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Audiology — hearing test; Orthopaedic outpatient — knee follow-up; Memory clinic — baseline screening.
Admin: Patient self-employed; flexible appointment slots requested.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


One correction to that last paragraph before anybody acts on it: the documents this task actually serves are radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results, plus the family-history anamnesis. There is NO pathology report to pull up in a task-1 biopsy decision — the prior-biopsy status on the panel above is all the pathology on record, and whatever the previous notes say about it. Nobody should ask for one, and nobody should quote one.

## Intervención 3 — EXPERT-STRUCTURED

*Expert 1, Extra-Trees on the structured panel only; opening bid with an error bar* · vuelta 1

Expert 1 here — the classifier that reads the structured panel and nothing else. My bid:

SUGGESTION: NO BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.40
  uncertainty  +/- 0.18 epistemic (95% band 0.04-0.75); among patients I cannot tell apart the outcome was 0.97 of 1.00 mixed
  reliability  LOW ('discuss' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 55% of the time over the 38 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most, across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, PI-RADS >= 4, no prior biopsy, pmhx_hypercholesterolaemia, suspicious DRE, number of comorbidities. I read 39 variables, all
from the panel — nothing from the mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the
laboratory. Out-of-fold over 91 labelled cases: AUC 0.758, balanced
accuracy 0.625.

The final call is the chair's.

## Intervención 4 — EXPERT-COHORT

*cohort criterion; what the labelled series did in this exact situation* · vuelta 1

This patient's situation: prior positive biopsy. My criterion answers DEFER.

The criterion: PSA >= 20 ng/mL in a man with a tissue diagnosis: the next step is staging and treatment, not more tissue. In the labelled series this criterion matched the reading urologist in 5 of 6 cases in exactly this situation.

Like Expert 1, I have read ONLY the visible panel — not the mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the
previous notes or the laboratory panel. Departing from me needs a specific finding from a document
somebody actually opened, named out loud; not a restatement of the panel numbers I already used.

## Intervención 5 — EXPERT-LIBRARY

*case library; the closest labelled precedents and what the reading urologist did with them* · vuelta 1

The case library holds 48 labelled men in this same situation (Positive prior biopsy). The 3 closest by panel distance, and what the reading urologist did:
  1. distance 0.72: PI-RADS 5, PSA 190.0, PSAD 4.097, age 66, DRE Nodus -> DEFER (clear). He wrote: "Patient with a clear PCa diagnosis. Do PSMA-PET and start hormontreatment"
  2. distance 0.79: PI-RADS 5, PSA 113.0, PSAD 2.61, age 67, DRE Nodus -> DEFER (clear). He wrote: "Patient has a verified PCa with PSA 113. Start treatment and do I PSMA-PET for further workup."
  3. distance 1.74: PI-RADS 5, PSA 187.0, PSAD 3.26, age 75, DRE Nodus -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "Very High PSA. Most likely metastatic"

PRECEDENT: DEFER (weighted vote 0.18 for biopsy). Distance-weighted precedent is no better than chance here (0.47 leave-one-out): read the precedents for how this urologist reasons, not for the answer.

What the precedents are FOR: they show what this urologist looks at and how he phrases the call. What they are NOT: facts about this patient. Nobody may cite a precedent's grade, PSA or MRI as if it were his.

## Intervención 6 — EXPERT-TRACE

*Expert 4, trace model; which documents the reading urologist opens and what he weighs in this situation* · vuelta 1

Expert 4 here — the model of how the reading urologist works a case like this. Predicted from his 48 labelled traces in this situation (Positive prior biopsy): a per-field model where it beats the mode out of fold (prior-biopsy weight, DRE weight, PI-RADS weight, and whether he opens the laboratory), the mode elsewhere.

WHAT HE OPENS: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes.
WHAT HE WEIGHS: bx=decisive, fh=noted, age=important, dre=noted, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=decisive, comorbidity=noted.
HOW SURE HE USUALLY IS: clear.

MODERATOR: that list of documents is the plan — exactly those, no more. Every document opened beyond what
he would open is scored against the conference as an unnecessary reveal; every document left closed
leaves a variable he weighed without its source. Attach the question each one must answer.

## Intervención 7 — EXPERT-EAU

*EAU guideline specialist; speaks only from the guideline text he retrieved* · vuelta 1

GUIDELINE
The guideline suggests that a PI-RADS score of 3 or higher is used to trigger a biopsy. "a PI-RADS threshold of \u2265 3 is used to trigger biopsy [135, 226, 264, 375]". This requires a decision based on the MRI findings.

WHAT THE EXPERTS' BIDS DO NOT SETTLE
EXPERT-STRUCTURED, I disagree with the suggestion of no biopsy because the patient has a PI-RADS 5, which is a high-risk finding. EXPERT-COHORT, I disagree with the DEFER recommendation because the criterion states that for a patient with a tissue diagnosis, the next step is staging and treatment, not more tissue.

WHAT WE STILL NEED
The prior-biopsy status is 'Positive', which is a fact that the guideline makes decisive.
The PI-RADS score is '5', which is a value that the guideline makes decisive.
The PSA is '160.0 ng/mL', which is a value that the guideline makes decisive.
The PSA density is '2.635 ng/mL²', which is a value that the guideline makes decisive.
The prostate volume is '60.71 mL', which is a value that the guideline makes decisive.
The DRE finding is 'Abnormal', which is a value that the guideline makes decisive.
The prior biopsy status is 'Positive', which is a fact that the guideline makes decisive.

## Intervención 8 — MODERATOR

*chairs the discussion; sets the open questions and assigns the documents* · vuelta 1

This case hinges on reconciling the high-risk MRI finding and elevated PSA against the cohort criterion for patients with prior biopsy results.

The documents for this session were fixed by EXPERT-TRACE; what I add is the question each one has to answer, and the open questions for the room.

REGISTRAR — pull these up, and answer exactly the question attached to each:
  radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> What is the lesion size and zone, extraprostatic extension, and comparison to earlier studies?
  psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> What is the serial PSA trend (rising, flat, or falling) beyond the headline value?
  previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> What is the Gleason/ISUP grade of the prior biopsy, the number and dates of biopsy sessions, and the surveillance plan?

OPEN QUESTIONS for this conference — these are what the decision hangs on:
  Q1. What is the Gleason/ISUP grade of the prior positive biopsy?
  Q2. Is the patient currently on a surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due?

## Intervención 9 — REGISTRAR

*the registrar who pulls up documents; reports what they say, nothing else* · vuelta 1

WHAT I FOUND
radiology_report
Subject: Prostate Multiparametric MRI | Date: 20 January 2025 | Facility: Amsterdam UMC (AMC)
COMPARISON: new
LESION: size and zone of the index lesion, as the report words it: "A discrete abnormality resides in the left peripheral zone, spanning roughly 35 mm at its widest point. Imaging characteristics include pronounced T2 hypointensity, marked diffusion restriction paired with depressed ADC values, and prompt contrast uptake on dynamic sequences. Suspicion for extracapsular extension centers on the left posterolateral margin."

psa_trend
What is the serial PSA trend (rising, flat, or falling) beyond the headline value?: The serial PSA trend is rising, with values: "Aug 2022, 14.8", "Jun 2023, 18.9", "Apr 2024, 12.0", "Jan 2025, 160.0".

previous_notes
What is the Gleason/ISUP grade of the prior biopsy, the number and dates of biopsy sessions, and the surveillance plan?: Gleason/ISUP grade of the prior biopsy: "Gleason 3+4 pathology". Number and dates of biopsy sessions: "one biopsy confirmed". Surveillance plan: "The clinical record was then submitted to the urology department for case review."

WHAT I DID NOT OPEN
family-history anamnesis, because the information was not required to answer the specific questions posed by the moderator.

WHAT THIS SUPPORTS
findings that argue FOR sampling this patient now
PI-RADS 5 lesion in the left peripheral zone with suspected extracapsular extension.
PSA trend shows a significant rise culminating in 160.0 ng/mL.

findings that argue AGAINST sampling this patient now
Prior positive biopsy status, as per the cohort criterion.

WHERE THIS LEANS
The high-risk MRI finding and the significant PSA rise strongly suggest a need for further tissue diagnosis.
LEAN: biopsy

## Intervención 10 — EXPERT-PSA

*Expert 2, PSA projector; the trajectory behind the headline PSA, with a conformal band* · vuelta 1

Expert 2 here — the PSA projector. I read only the serial PSA the registrar opened.

TRAJECTORY: RISING (clear). Last value 160.00 ng/mL over 4 points spanning 29 months; velocity +51.87 ng/mL per year; doubling time about 10 months.
PROJECTION at 6 months: 618.3 ng/mL, conformal 95% band 177.4-2155.0.

Read the band before the point: it is wide by construction, and I only call a direction when the whole
band clears the last value. This does not vote on the biopsy — a rising PSA in a man with a known
diagnosis is the disease behaving as known — it tells the chair how fast the number is moving.

## Intervención 11 — EXPERT-FUSION

*Expert 3, Extra-Trees on panel + laboratory + MRI prose; speaks only on documents that were opened* · vuelta 1

Expert 3 here — the fusion classifier. I read the panel, the mpMRI report — the laboratory panel was not opened, so that block is imputed and my band is wider for it; nothing from the previous notes or the PSA series.

SUGGESTION: NO BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.40
  uncertainty  +/- 0.17 epistemic (95% band 0.07-0.73), of which 0.00 comes from values that had to be imputed
  reliability  LOW ('discuss' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 59% of the time over the 29 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, no prior biopsy, free PSA < 15%, DWI restriction in the report, lesion >= 15 mm in the report, suspicious DRE. Out-of-fold AUC 0.794. I am the only expert that has read the report's wording, and I still cannot see the prior grade or the
surveillance history: those are in the notes, and the registrar has to carry them.

## Intervención 12 — PANEL-PROTOCOL

*the panel's written protocol; consolidates the experts by rule and says which rule fired* · vuelta 1

The panel protocol, applied to what is on the board:

  EXPERT-STRUCTURED  DEFER, p(biopsy)=0.40  ('discuss' tier; weight 1.0)
  EXPERT-FUSION      DEFER, p(biopsy)=0.40  ('discuss' tier, fusion_nolab; weight 1.5)
  EXPERT-LIBRARY     DEFER, p(biopsy)=0.18  (k=3 precedents; does not vote)
  EXPERT-COHORT      DEFER  (rule psa_ge_20; does not vote)

  documented prior grade in the opened documents: GG 2 ("Gleason 3+4")

RULE THAT FIRED: cohort criterion (psa_ge_20) — carried by EXPERT-COHORT.
PANEL ANSWER: NO BIOPSY. It matched the reading urologist in 5 of 6 labelled cases in exactly this situation (prior positive biopsy).

Confidence the trace model expects here: clear. Weights it expects: bx=decisive, fh=noted, age=important, dre=noted, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=decisive, comorbidity=noted.

CHAIR: this is the panel's position. You sign it, and you write why in the room's words — naming what the registrar retrieved. If you believe a retrieved finding overturns it, name that finding with its value; the burden is on the finding, not on the panel.

## Intervención 13 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

SUFFICIENCY
The documents retrieved by the registrar—the radiology report, PSA trend, and previous notes—directly address the moderator's questions.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE PANEL
The retrieved finding regarding the prior biopsy grade, "Gleason 3+4 pathology," is documented, which aligns with the Panel Protocol's conclusion of NO BIOPSY, as the cohort criterion was met.

THE OPEN QUESTIONS, ONE BY ONE
Q1. What is the Gleason/ISUP grade of the prior positive biopsy? Answered by the registrar: "Gleason 3+4 pathology". Q2. Is the patient currently on a surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due? This question remains unanswered by the retrieved documents.

WHAT CARRIES WEIGHT, AND WHY
The Gleason/ISUP grade of the prior biopsy is critical because it is a documented finding that informs the interpretation of the cohort criterion. The PSA trend is also important as it shows a significant rise culminating in 160.0 ng/mL.

MY SUGGESTION TO THE CHAIR
The evidence retrieved confirms the Panel Protocol's decision based on the cohort criterion. However, the status of the surveillance protocol (Q2) is not clarified by the retrieved documents, which is a missing piece of information.

VERDICT: ready | SUGGEST: defer | MISSING: none

[The conference closes after pass 1: the verifier called the record ready. The chair decides on the record as it stands.]

## Intervención 14 — CHAIR

*the senior urologist who signs the decision* · vuelta 1

MY DECISION: NO BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

63y/o, PSA 160, PSAD 2.635, PI-RADS 5, prior biopsy Gleason 3+4. High PSA and documented prior high grade dictate staging and treatment over repeat biopsy. The PI-RADS 5 finding is consistent with known cancer status, making further tissue sampling inappropriate. Plan is staging and treatment.

What carried weight: bx=decisive, age=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=decisive, comorbidity=noted
Sections retrieved: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes
