## Intervención 2 — INTAKE

*the record clerk; reads the file out loud and interprets nothing* · vuelta 1

And this is the same record as the reading form presents it — the panel the urologist sees up front, with the masked documents named but not shown.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_4a2fa7bc3595
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 26 Feb 2025.
Referrer: Dr. M. Jansen (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 67-year-old male
  - PSA: 6.9 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 5 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.257 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: -0.62 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 5.6 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 26.9 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 3
  - DRE findings: Nodus (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.84531116 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Type 2 diabetes, Osteoarthritis, Benign prostatic hyperplasia
  - Problem list / PMHx: Type 2 diabetes, Osteoarthritis, Benign prostatic hyperplasia
  - Current medication: metformin, empagliflozin, paracetamol PRN
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 6.9 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 0.26. Prostate volume 27 mL. DRE nodus. csPCa 0.85.

Vitals: weight 70 kg, height 172 cm, BMI 23.7, BP 106/78 mmHg, HR 71 bpm. Smoking: Ex-smoker (16 pack-yr, quit 2006).

Chief complaint: Assessment requested to review previous biopsy results alongside recent changes in prostate-specific antigen levels.

History: At 67 years of age, this retired electrical engineer initially entered diagnostic evaluation in early 2023 due to elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. Chronic conditions include type 2 diabetes, controlled through metformin and empagliflozin, as well as osteoarthritis managed with paracetamol taken only when necessary. He shares his home with his married partner and sustains a daily 45-minute walking habit, limiting alcohol intake to approximately three weekly units. A substantial smoking history of 16 pack-years existed until cessation in 2006. Urological interventions remain limited to the initial systematic biopsy that confirmed malignancy. Lower urinary tract symptoms manifest only as occasional mild frequency, aligning with established benign prostatic hyperplasia. He denies urinary retention or hematuria. Recent primary care activities included routine thyroid screening, while suspected obstructive sleep apnoea is currently addressed via positional therapy and pending specialist review. Functional independence remains fully preserved across all daily activities.

Physical examination: DRE — texture: firm, asymmetry: present. A discrete 1.5 cm mass is palpable within the right peripheral zone, consistent with a localized Nodus. The remaining prostatic tissue feels smooth and elicits no tenderness upon palpation. Systemic examination shows stable hemodynamics, clear lung fields, and an absence of peripheral lymph node enlargement.

Patient info: retired electrical engineer; Married; Lives with partner.
Next of kin: Sibling (sister).

Lifestyle: alcohol 3 units / week; exercise Walking 45 min/day; IPSS score: 7/35 (mild LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Endocrine — thyroid screening; Sleep clinic — suspected obstructive sleep apnoea.
Admin: Visual impairment: large-print correspondence requested.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


One correction to that last paragraph before anybody acts on it: the documents this task actually serves are radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results, plus the family-history anamnesis. There is NO pathology report to pull up in a task-1 biopsy decision — the prior-biopsy status on the panel above is all the pathology on record, and whatever the previous notes say about it. Nobody should ask for one, and nobody should quote one.

## Intervención 3 — EXPERT-STRUCTURED

*Expert 1, Extra-Trees on the structured panel only; opening bid with an error bar* · vuelta 1

Expert 1 here — the classifier that reads the structured panel and nothing else. My bid:

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.63
  uncertainty  +/- 0.15 epistemic (95% band 0.34-0.92); among patients I cannot tell apart the outcome was 0.95 of 1.00 mixed
  reliability  LOW ('discuss' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 55% of the time over the 38 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most, across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, PI-RADS >= 4, no prior biopsy, pmhx_hypercholesterolaemia, suspicious DRE, number of comorbidities. I read 39 variables, all
from the panel — nothing from the mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the
laboratory. Out-of-fold over 91 labelled cases: AUC 0.758, balanced
accuracy 0.625.

The final call is the chair's.

## Intervención 4 — EXPERT-COHORT

*cohort criterion; what the labelled series did in this exact situation* · vuelta 1

This patient's situation: prior positive biopsy. The panel alone does not answer, and that is the finding.

The criterion here is that the visible panel does not determine this decision: he already has a tissue diagnosis, so neither a high PI-RADS nor a rising PSA is new information. What decides it is the documented grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance history, which live in the previous notes. Measured on the labelled series: none of the three panel
rules I carry for this situation (PSA >= 20, age >= 78, PI-RADS <= 2) applies to him, and among the
39 remaining labelled men in this situation no structured variable separates the two answers.

REGISTRAR: the previous notes are where this case is decided. Read them for the grade of the prior
biopsy (Gleason or ISUP), the number of biopsy sessions and their dates, and whether he is on a
surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due. Do not read this as 'defer' and do not read it
as 'biopsy'.

## Intervención 5 — EXPERT-LIBRARY

*case library; the closest labelled precedents and what the reading urologist did with them* · vuelta 1

The case library holds 48 labelled men in this same situation (Positive prior biopsy). The 3 closest by panel distance, and what the reading urologist did:
  1. distance 0.49: PI-RADS 5, PSA 8.3, PSAD 0.215, age 66, DRE Suspicious -> DEFER (clear). He wrote: "This person should discuss curative treatment (younger patient with palpable, MRI-visible high-risk disease incl Gleason 5 findings). If not curative treatment for any r…"
  2. distance 0.60: PI-RADS 5, PSA 6.9, PSAD 0.171, age 67, DRE Nodus -> DEFER (borderline). He wrote: "Need to know if the P5 lesion has grown in size. If not no biopsy."
  3. distance 0.62: PI-RADS 5, PSA 8.6, PSAD 0.202, age 68, DRE Nodus -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "Patient reasonable to discuss curative treatment with (age 68, no very dramatic comorbidity, unfavorable intermediate risk disease). Considering he chose not curative tr…"

PRECEDENT: DEFER (weighted vote 0.31 for biopsy). Distance-weighted precedent is no better than chance here (0.47 leave-one-out): read the precedents for how this urologist reasons, not for the answer.

What the precedents are FOR: they show what this urologist looks at and how he phrases the call. What they are NOT: facts about this patient. Nobody may cite a precedent's grade, PSA or MRI as if it were his.

## Intervención 6 — EXPERT-TRACE

*Expert 4, trace model; which documents the reading urologist opens and what he weighs in this situation* · vuelta 1

Expert 4 here — the model of how the reading urologist works a case like this. Predicted from his 48 labelled traces in this situation (Positive prior biopsy): a per-field model where it beats the mode out of fold (prior-biopsy weight, DRE weight, PI-RADS weight, and whether he opens the laboratory), the mode elsewhere.

WHAT HE OPENS: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results.
WHAT HE WEIGHS: bx=important, fh=noted, age=important, dre=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=important, comorbidity=noted.
HOW SURE HE USUALLY IS: clear.

MODERATOR: that list of documents is the plan — exactly those, no more. Every document opened beyond what
he would open is scored against the conference as an unnecessary reveal; every document left closed
leaves a variable he weighed without its source. Attach the question each one must answer.

## Intervención 7 — EXPERT-EAU

*EAU guideline specialist; speaks only from the guideline text he retrieved* · vuelta 1

GUIDELINE
The guideline addresses the decision to perform a biopsy based on the PI-RADS score and PSA density. "linking PI-RADS score (1-2, 3, and 4-5) to PSA-D categories (< 0.10, 0.10-0.15, 0.20ng/mL and > 0.20ng/mL) (Table 5.5) [230]. This risk-adapted matrix table may guide the decision to perform a biopsy." For this patient, the PI-RADS score is 5 and the PSA density is 0.257 ng/mL², which falls into the > 0.20 ng/mL/cc category.

WHAT THE EXPERTS' BIDS DO NOT SETTLE
EXPERT-STRUCTURED, I disagree with the suggestion of biopsy because the guideline suggests a risk-adapted matrix table should guide the decision, which is not fully reflected in the panel variables alone. EXPERT-COHORT, the finding that the panel alone does not determine the decision is correct, but the guideline implies that variables like PSA density and PI-RADS should be used in conjunction with other factors to determine the risk-adapted pathway.

WHAT THE DOCUMENTS MUST SETTLE
previous_notes - the documented grade of the prior biopsy: at ISUP 2 or above the guideline sends him to treatment, not to more tissue; if it is unrecorded the indication stands
radiology_report - whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study: unchanged does not support re-sampling, new or larger does
psa_trend - the trend of the PSA: a rising PSA is a factor that should be considered in the risk-adapted matrix table
laboratory_results - the PSA density: this value is a key component of the risk-adapted matrix table that dictates the biopsy decision

## Intervención 8 — MODERATOR

*chairs the discussion; sets the open questions and assigns the documents* · vuelta 1

This case hinges on the documented grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance plan detailed in the previous notes.

The documents for this session were fixed by EXPERT-TRACE; what I add is the question each one has to answer, and the open questions for the room.

REGISTRAR — pull these up, and answer exactly the question attached to each:
  radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Determine whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study.
  psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> Determine the trend of the PSA.
  previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> Determine the documented grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance protocol status.
  laboratory_results (get_lab_results) -> Determine the PSA density value for the risk-adapted matrix table.

OPEN QUESTIONS for this conference — these are what the decision hangs on:
  Q1. What is the documented grade (Gleason/ISUP) of the prior biopsy?
  Q2. Is the lesion described in the radiology report compared against an earlier study?
  Q3. What is the trend of the PSA?

On the plan itself: Dropped 1 question(s) that asked for a value already printed on the panel: "What is the PSA density value used in the risk-adapted matrix table?".

## Intervención 9 — REGISTRAR

*the registrar who pulls up documents; reports what they say, nothing else* · vuelta 1

WHAT I FOUND
radiology_report
COMPARISON: new
LESION: size 14 by 11 by 10 mm, zone right peripheral zone

psa_trend
PSA 2.3 (Apr 2023) rising to 6.9 (Feb 2025), rising over the last 11 months

previous_notes
PRIOR GRADE: Positive
BIOPSY SESSIONS: 1, on 29 Oct 2024
SURVEILLANCE: Conservative observation continued during the waiting period
TREATMENT: none recorded

laboratory_results
PSA density value for the risk-adapted matrix table is 0.257 ng/mL/mL

WHAT I DID NOT OPEN
family-history anamnesis, because the previous notes provided the necessary information regarding the prior biopsy status and surveillance.

WHAT THIS SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now
PI-RADS score of 5 from the mpMRI report
PSA density of 0.257 ng/mL/mL, which falls into the > 0.20 ng/mL/cc category per EAU guideline

AGAINST sampling this patient now
Prior biopsy result is documented, and the previous notes do not specify a grade or surveillance protocol status.

WHERE THIS LEANS
LEAN: biopsy

## Intervención 10 — EXPERT-PSA

*Expert 2, PSA projector; the trajectory behind the headline PSA, with a conformal band* · vuelta 1

Expert 2 here — the PSA projector. I read only the serial PSA the registrar opened.

TRAJECTORY: RISING (borderline). Last value 6.90 ng/mL over 3 points spanning 22 months; velocity +2.51 ng/mL per year; doubling time about 14 months.
PROJECTION at 6 months: 10.3 ng/mL, conformal 95% band 2.9-35.8.

Read the band before the point: it is wide by construction, and I only call a direction when the whole
band clears the last value. This does not vote on the biopsy — a rising PSA in a man with a known
diagnosis is the disease behaving as known — it tells the chair how fast the number is moving.

## Intervención 11 — EXPERT-FUSION

*Expert 3, Extra-Trees on panel + laboratory + MRI prose; speaks only on documents that were opened* · vuelta 1

Expert 3 here — the fusion classifier. I read the panel, the mpMRI report and the laboratory panel; nothing from the previous notes or the PSA series.

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.70
  uncertainty  +/- 0.14 epistemic (95% band 0.44-0.97), of which 0.00 comes from values that had to be imputed
  reliability  MODERATE ('supports' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 71% of the time over the 24 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, no prior biopsy, free PSA < 15%, DWI restriction in the report, lesion >= 15 mm in the report, suspicious DRE. Out-of-fold AUC 0.794. I am the only expert that has read the report's wording, and I still cannot see the prior grade or the
surveillance history: those are in the notes, and the registrar has to carry them.

## Intervención 12 — PANEL-PROTOCOL

*the panel's written protocol; consolidates the experts by rule and says which rule fired* · vuelta 1

The panel protocol, applied to what is on the board:

  EXPERT-STRUCTURED  BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.63  ('discuss' tier; weight 1.0)
  EXPERT-FUSION      BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.70  ('supports' tier, fusion_full; weight 3.0)
  EXPERT-LIBRARY     DEFER, p(biopsy)=0.31  (k=3 precedents; does not vote)

  documented prior grade in the opened documents: none recorded

RULE THAT FIRED: weighted vote of the trained experts, p = 0.68 — carried by weighted panel.
PANEL ANSWER: BIOPSY. EXPERT-FUSION carried the most weight ('supports' tier, fusion_full). In this bucket no rule applied and the documents did not record the prior grade, so the trained experts decide.
Dissenting on the board: EXPERT-LIBRARY. Their bids are recorded above; they did not carry because a higher rung of the protocol applied.

Confidence the trace model expects here: clear. Weights it expects: bx=important, fh=noted, age=important, dre=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=important, comorbidity=noted.

CHAIR: this is the panel's position. You sign it, and you write why in the room's words — naming what the registrar retrieved. If you believe a retrieved finding overturns it, name that finding with its value; the burden is on the finding, not on the panel.

## Intervención 13 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

SUFFICIENCY
The documents retrieved by the registrar appear to have answered all three moderator questions: the `previous_notes` provided the prior biopsy status, the `radiology_report` addressed the comparison status, and the `psa_trend` detailed the PSA trend.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE PANEL
The panel protocol concluded with a weighted vote for BIOPSY based on the experts' bids, despite the lack of a documented prior grade in the opened documents. The retrieved information supports the need for further action, as the PSA density and PI-RADS score align with the EAU guideline's risk-adapted matrix.

THE OPEN QUESTIONS, ONE BY ONE
Q1. What is the documented grade (Gleason/ISUP) of the prior biopsy? Answered by `previous_notes`: PRIOR GRADE: Positive.
Q2. Is the lesion described in the radiology report compared against an earlier study? Answered by `radiology_report`: COMPARISON: new.
Q3. What is the trend of the PSA? Answered by `psa_trend`: PSA 2.3 (Apr 2023) rising to 6.9 (Feb 2025), rising over the last 11 months.

WHAT CARRIES WEIGHT, AND WHY
The PSA density (0.257 ng/mL/mL) is highly relevant as it falls into the > 0.20 ng/mL/cc category per the EAU guideline, directly influencing the risk-adapted matrix. The documented prior biopsy status, though lacking a grade, is a key factor the panel noted as unrecorded.

MY SUGGESTION TO THE CHAIR
Given the PI-RADS 5, the high PSA density, and the rising PSA trend, the guideline suggests a risk-adapted matrix should guide the decision. I suggest proceeding with biopsy to establish the documented grade of the prior biopsy and confirm the current status, leaning towards biopsy.

VERDICT: ready | SUGGEST: biopsy | MISSING: none

[The conference closes after pass 1: the verifier called the record ready. The chair decides on the record as it stands.]

## Intervención 14 — CHAIR

*the senior urologist who signs the decision* · vuelta 1

MY DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

67y male, PSA 6.9, PSAD 0.257, PI-RADS 5, prior positive biopsy grade unrecorded. High PI-RADS 5 and rising PSA suggest progression despite prior biopsy. Lack of prior grade mandates sampling to determine management pathway.

What carried weight: bx=important, age=important, dre=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=important, comorbidity=noted
