## Intervención 2 — INTAKE

*the record clerk; reads the file out loud and interprets nothing* · vuelta 1

And this is the same record as the reading form presents it — the panel the urologist sees up front, with the masked documents named but not shown.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_0615b2bd8504
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 26 Jan 2025.
Referrer: Dr. C. Peters (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 63-year-old male
  - PSA: 160.0 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 5 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 2.635 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 35.73 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 115.9 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 60.71 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 1
  - DRE findings: Abnormal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.95889634 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Not reported
  - Problem list / PMHx: none recorded
  - Current medication: None
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 160 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 2.63. Prostate volume 61 mL. DRE abnormal. csPCa 0.96.

Vitals: weight 93 kg, height 191 cm, BMI 25.5, BP 140/81 mmHg, HR 48 bpm. Smoking: Current smoker (20 pack-yr).

Chief complaint: Persistent elevation in PSA levels alongside a history of biopsy-confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma warrants clinical reassessment.

History: Now aged 63-year-old, the individual works as a retired bank clerk and Lives in ground-floor apartment with partner. Following an initial PSA measurement of 55.0 ng/mL in late 2022, a prior biopsy bucket "Positive" was documented. He maintains a Married status and engages in light resistance training twice weekly, complemented by a moderate alcohol intake of 14 units per week. Current smoker (20 pack-yr) status is noted, though he explicitly denies haematuria, pelvic discomfort, or lower urinary tract symptoms exceeding a baseline IPSS of 10. Past medical reviews include a routine hearing evaluation, an orthopaedic check for stable knee osteoarthritis, and a memory clinic assessment revealing intact cognition. He has never utilized 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. General health remains excellent with an ECOG performance status of 0. Comorbidities: none. Active medication: None.

Physical examination: DRE — texture: firm and irregular nodule palpable in the left posterior peripheral zone; mobility: fixed; asymmetry: pronounced enlargement with right lobe induration but no distinct discrete masses; overall classification: cT3a. Abnormal DRE confirmed. Vital signs record a blood pressure of 140/81 mmHg and a resting heart rate of 48 bpm. General survey shows no palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

Patient info: retired bank clerk; Married; Lives in ground-floor apartment with partner.
Next of kin: Sibling (brother).

Lifestyle: alcohol 14 units / week; exercise Light weight-training at home, 2x/week; IPSS score: 10/35 (moderate LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Audiology — hearing test; Orthopaedic outpatient — knee follow-up; Memory clinic — baseline screening.
Admin: Patient self-employed; flexible appointment slots requested.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


One correction to that last paragraph before anybody acts on it: the documents this task actually serves are radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results, plus the family-history anamnesis. There is NO pathology report to pull up in a task-1 biopsy decision — the prior-biopsy status on the panel above is all the pathology on record, and whatever the previous notes say about it. Nobody should ask for one, and nobody should quote one.

## Intervención 3 — EXPERT-STRUCTURED

*Expert 1, Extra-Trees on the structured panel only; opening bid with an error bar* · vuelta 1

Expert 1 here — the classifier that reads the structured panel and nothing else. My bid:

SUGGESTION: NO BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.40
  uncertainty  +/- 0.18 epistemic (95% band 0.04-0.75); among patients I cannot tell apart the outcome was 0.97 of 1.00 mixed
  reliability  LOW ('discuss' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 55% of the time over the 38 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most, across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, PI-RADS >= 4, no prior biopsy, pmhx_hypercholesterolaemia, suspicious DRE, number of comorbidities. I read 39 variables, all
from the panel — nothing from the mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the
laboratory. Out-of-fold over 91 labelled cases: AUC 0.758, balanced
accuracy 0.625.

The final call is the chair's.

## Intervención 4 — EXPERT-COHORT

*cohort criterion; what the labelled series did in this exact situation* · vuelta 1

This patient's situation: prior positive biopsy. My criterion answers DEFER.

The criterion: PSA >= 20 ng/mL in a man with a tissue diagnosis: the next step is staging and treatment, not more tissue. In the labelled series this criterion matched the reading urologist in 5 of 6 cases in exactly this situation.

Like Expert 1, I have read ONLY the visible panel — not the mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the
previous notes or the laboratory panel. Departing from me needs a specific finding from a document
somebody actually opened, named out loud; not a restatement of the panel numbers I already used.

## Intervención 5 — EXPERT-LIBRARY

*case library; the closest labelled precedents and what the reading urologist did with them* · vuelta 1

The case library holds 48 labelled men in this same situation (Positive prior biopsy). The 3 closest by panel distance, and what the reading urologist did:
  1. distance 0.72: PI-RADS 5, PSA 190.0, PSAD 4.097, age 66, DRE Nodus -> DEFER (clear). He wrote: "Patient with a clear PCa diagnosis. Do PSMA-PET and start hormontreatment"
  2. distance 0.79: PI-RADS 5, PSA 113.0, PSAD 2.61, age 67, DRE Nodus -> DEFER (clear). He wrote: "Patient has a verified PCa with PSA 113. Start treatment and do I PSMA-PET for further workup."
  3. distance 1.74: PI-RADS 5, PSA 187.0, PSAD 3.26, age 75, DRE Nodus -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "Very High PSA. Most likely metastatic"

PRECEDENT: DEFER (weighted vote 0.18 for biopsy). Distance-weighted precedent is no better than chance here (0.47 leave-one-out): read the precedents for how this urologist reasons, not for the answer.

What the precedents are FOR: they show what this urologist looks at and how he phrases the call. What they are NOT: facts about this patient. Nobody may cite a precedent's grade, PSA or MRI as if it were his.

## Intervención 6 — EXPERT-TRACE

*Expert 4, trace model; which documents the reading urologist opens and what he weighs in this situation* · vuelta 1

Expert 4 here — the model of how the reading urologist works a case like this. Predicted from his 48 labelled traces in this situation (Positive prior biopsy): a per-field model where it beats the mode out of fold (prior-biopsy weight, DRE weight, PI-RADS weight, and whether he opens the laboratory), the mode elsewhere.

WHAT HE OPENS: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes.
WHAT HE WEIGHS: bx=decisive, fh=noted, age=important, dre=noted, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=decisive, comorbidity=noted.
HOW SURE HE USUALLY IS: clear.

MODERATOR: that list of documents is the plan — exactly those, no more. Every document opened beyond what
he would open is scored against the conference as an unnecessary reveal; every document left closed
leaves a variable he weighed without its source. Attach the question each one must answer.

## Intervención 7 — EXPERT-EAU

*EAU guideline specialist; speaks only from the guideline text he retrieved* · vuelta 1

GUIDELINE
The EAU guidelines suggest that a PI-RADS score of 5 mandates a repeat biopsy to confirm histological progression before a change in treatment strategy. The guideline states: "sion on MRI mandates a repeat biopsy to confirm histological progression before a change in treatment strategy." This requires a repeat biopsy for this patient.

WHAT THE EXPERTS' BIDS DO NOT SETTLE
EXPERT-STRUCTURED, I disagree with the suggestion of 'NO BIOPSY' because the guideline makes the PI-RADS 5 finding decisive for mandating a repeat biopsy. EXPERT-COHORT, your criterion focusing only on a prior positive biopsy does not account for the high-risk nature indicated by the PI-RADS 5 score, which is a decisive factor according to the guideline.

WHAT THE DOCUMENTS MUST SETTLE
previous_notes - the prior biopsy status: at Positive the guideline suggests the indication stands
radiology_report - whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study: unchanged does not support re-sampling, new or larger does
psa_trend - the PSA velocity: the guideline does not specify a threshold for PSA velocity, but the high-risk MRI suggests the indication stands
laboratory_results - the PSA density: the guideline does not specify a threshold for PSA density, but the high-risk MRI suggests the indication stands

## Intervención 8 — MODERATOR

*chairs the discussion; sets the open questions and assigns the documents* · vuelta 1

This case hinges on whether the PI-RADS 5 mandates a repeat biopsy according to the EAU guidelines, and what the previous notes state regarding the prior positive biopsy.

The documents for this session were fixed by EXPERT-TRACE; what I add is the question each one has to answer, and the open questions for the room.

REGISTRAR — pull these up, and answer exactly the question attached to each:
  radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Must indicate whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study.
  psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> Must indicate the PSA velocity to assess the indication for re-biopsy.
  previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> Must detail the grade (Gleason/ISUP) and timing of the prior positive biopsy.

OPEN QUESTIONS for this conference — these are what the decision hangs on:
  Q1. Does the radiology_report indicate whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study?
  Q2. What does the previous_notes state regarding the grade (Gleason/ISUP) and timing of the prior positive biopsy?
  Q3. Does the psa_trend indicate a PSA velocity that would influence the decision, given the high-risk MRI?

## Intervención 9 — REGISTRAR

*the registrar who pulls up documents; reports what they say, nothing else* · vuelta 1

WHAT I FOUND
radiology_report
The radiology_report indicates that the lesion is compared against an earlier study, as the indication was "Rising PSA (160.0 ng/mL) alongside a previously positive biopsy history."
psa_trend
The psa_trend shows a PSA velocity from 14.8 (Aug 2022) to 160.0 (Jan 2025), indicating a significant rise.
previous_notes
The previous_notes detail that the prior positive biopsy was confirmed as Gleason 3+4 pathology on "31 May 2024."

WHAT I DID NOT OPEN
I did not open the laboratory_results or the family-history anamnesis because the required information regarding PSA density and family history was not explicitly requested by the moderator's open questions.

WHAT THIS SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now
The radiology_report indicates a PI-RADS 5 lesion with suspected extracapsular extension, which mandates a repeat biopsy according to the EAU guideline.
The psa_trend shows a significant PSA velocity, supporting the indication for re-biopsy given the high-risk MRI.
AGAINST sampling this patient now
The previous_notes confirm a prior positive biopsy, which, in some contexts, might suggest deferral if the current findings were less concerning.

WHERE THIS LEANS
LEAN: biopsy

## Intervención 10 — EXPERT-PSA

*Expert 2, PSA projector; the trajectory behind the headline PSA, with a conformal band* · vuelta 1

Expert 2 here — the PSA projector. I read only the serial PSA the registrar opened.

TRAJECTORY: RISING (clear). Last value 160.00 ng/mL over 4 points spanning 29 months; velocity +51.87 ng/mL per year; doubling time about 10 months.
PROJECTION at 6 months: 618.3 ng/mL, conformal 95% band 177.4-2155.0.

Read the band before the point: it is wide by construction, and I only call a direction when the whole
band clears the last value. This does not vote on the biopsy — a rising PSA in a man with a known
diagnosis is the disease behaving as known — it tells the chair how fast the number is moving.

## Intervención 11 — EXPERT-FUSION

*Expert 3, Extra-Trees on panel + laboratory + MRI prose; speaks only on documents that were opened* · vuelta 1

Expert 3 here — the fusion classifier. I read the panel, the mpMRI report — the laboratory panel was not opened, so that block is imputed and my band is wider for it; nothing from the previous notes or the PSA series.

SUGGESTION: NO BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.40
  uncertainty  +/- 0.17 epistemic (95% band 0.07-0.73), of which 0.00 comes from values that had to be imputed
  reliability  LOW ('discuss' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 59% of the time over the 29 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, no prior biopsy, free PSA < 15%, DWI restriction in the report, lesion >= 15 mm in the report, suspicious DRE. Out-of-fold AUC 0.794. I am the only expert that has read the report's wording, and I still cannot see the prior grade or the
surveillance history: those are in the notes, and the registrar has to carry them.

## Intervención 12 — PANEL-PROTOCOL

*the panel's written protocol; consolidates the experts by rule and says which rule fired* · vuelta 1

The panel protocol, applied to what is on the board:

  EXPERT-STRUCTURED  DEFER, p(biopsy)=0.40  ('discuss' tier; weight 1.0)
  EXPERT-FUSION      DEFER, p(biopsy)=0.40  ('discuss' tier, fusion_nolab; weight 1.5)
  EXPERT-LIBRARY     DEFER, p(biopsy)=0.18  (k=3 precedents; does not vote)
  EXPERT-COHORT      DEFER  (rule psa_ge_20; does not vote)

  documented prior grade in the opened documents: GG 2 ("Gleason 3+4")

RULE THAT FIRED: cohort criterion (psa_ge_20) — carried by EXPERT-COHORT.
PANEL ANSWER: NO BIOPSY. It matched the reading urologist in 5 of 6 labelled cases in exactly this situation (prior positive biopsy).

Confidence the trace model expects here: clear. Weights it expects: bx=decisive, fh=noted, age=important, dre=noted, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=decisive, comorbidity=noted.

CHAIR: this is the panel's position. You sign it, and you write why in the room's words — naming what the registrar retrieved. If you believe a retrieved finding overturns it, name that finding with its value; the burden is on the finding, not on the panel.

## Intervención 13 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

SUFFICIENCY
The documents opened by the registrar—radiology_report, psa_trend, and previous_notes—directly address all three moderator questions.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE PANEL
The retrieved findings, specifically the radiology_report indicating comparison against an earlier study, the psa_trend showing a significant rise, and the previous_notes detailing the Gleason 3+4 pathology, align with the Registrar's summary that leaned towards biopsy, which contradicts the PANEL-PROTOCOL's final answer of NO BIOPSY based on the cohort criterion.

THE OPEN QUESTIONS, ONE BY ONE
Q1. Does the radiology_report indicate whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study? Yes, the report indicates the indication was "Rising PSA (160.0 ng/mL) alongside a previously positive biopsy history."
Q2. What does the previous_notes state regarding the grade (Gleason/ISUP) and timing of the prior positive biopsy? The previous_notes detail that the prior positive biopsy was confirmed as Gleason 3+4 pathology on "31 May 2024."
Q3. Does the psa_trend indicate a PSA velocity that would influence the decision, given the high-risk MRI? Yes, the psa_trend shows a PSA velocity from 14.8 (Aug 2022) to 160.0 (Jan 2025), indicating a significant rise.

WHAT CARRIES WEIGHT, AND WHY
The PI-RADS 5 score from the MRI is highly relevant as it is a decisive factor according to the EAU guideline, which mandates a repeat biopsy. The retrieved information on the prior positive biopsy (Gleason 3+4) and the significant PSA velocity support the indication for re-biopsy according to the EAU text.

MY SUGGESTION TO THE CHAIR
Based on the EAU guideline mandating a repeat biopsy for a PI-RADS 5 lesion, supported by the rising PSA velocity and the prior positive biopsy history, I suggest proceeding with a biopsy.

VERDICT: ready | SUGGEST: biopsy | MISSING: none

[The conference closes after pass 1: the verifier called the record ready. The chair decides on the record as it stands.]

## Intervención 14 — CHAIR

*the senior urologist who signs the decision* · vuelta 1

MY DECISION: NO BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

63y/o, PSA 160, PSAD 2.635, PI-RADS 5, prior positive biopsy with Gleason 3+4 confirmed. High PSA and prior confirmed grade dictate staging and treatment over repeat biopsy. No earlier MRI to compare against.

What carried weight: bx=decisive, age=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=decisive, comorbidity=noted
Sections retrieved: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes
