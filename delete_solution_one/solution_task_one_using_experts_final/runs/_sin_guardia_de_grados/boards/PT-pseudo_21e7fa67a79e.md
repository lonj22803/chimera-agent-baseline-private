## Intervención 2 — INTAKE

*the record clerk; reads the file out loud and interprets nothing* · vuelta 1

And this is the same record as the reading form presents it — the panel the urologist sees up front, with the masked documents named but not shown.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_21e7fa67a79e
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 01 Feb 2025.
Referrer: Dr. N. Kuiper (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 70-year-old male
  - PSA: 11.0 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 5 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.108 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 2.49 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 7.8 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 101.95 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 3
  - DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.77544403 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Not reported
  - Problem list / PMHx: none recorded
  - Current medication: None
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 11 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 0.11. Prostate volume 102 mL. csPCa 0.78.

Vitals: weight 100 kg, height 183 cm, BMI 29.9, BP 123/79 mmHg, HR 72 bpm. Smoking: Ex-smoker (29 pack-yr, quit 2007).

Chief complaint: Assessment of a previously positive prostate biopsy alongside a steadily climbing PSA trajectory.

History: First brought to clinical attention for a PSA elevation in late 2022, this 70-year-old gentleman has a previously positive prostate biopsy bucket recording Gleason 3+4 pathology. He endures severe lower urinary tract symptoms, scoring 34 on the IPSS, which heavily disrupts his daily activities despite a lack of prior surgical interventions. A retired postal worker who has never married, he resides alone with his adult daughter acting as primary contact and a longstanding friend listed as next of kin. His lifestyle includes cycling roughly 20 kilometres twice each week and drinking about five alcohol units weekly; he ceased smoking 29 pack-years ago back in 2007. Aside from a right knee arthroscopy in 2018 and a recent practice-nurse-administered influenza vaccine, his medical background remains clear. He explicitly denies unexplained weight loss, bone pain, or haematuria.

Physical examination: Normal DRE: The prostate measures symmetrically enlarged, presenting a smooth capsule devoid of palpable nodules or asymmetry. General examination remains unremarkable, characterised by stable vital signs and an absence of systemic illness or lymphadenopathy.

Patient info: retired postal worker; Never married; Lives alone; adult daughter is primary contact.
Next of kin: Long-time friend (no close family).

Lifestyle: alcohol 5 units / week; exercise Cycling 2x/week, ~20 km; IPSS score: 34/35 (severe LUTS).

Recent other appointments: GP practice nurse — flu vaccination.
Admin: Interpreter: not required. Consent for data use: signed.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


One correction to that last paragraph before anybody acts on it: the documents this task actually serves are radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results, plus the family-history anamnesis. There is NO pathology report to pull up in a task-1 biopsy decision — the prior-biopsy status on the panel above is all the pathology on record, and whatever the previous notes say about it. Nobody should ask for one, and nobody should quote one.

## Intervención 3 — EXPERT-STRUCTURED

*Expert 1, Extra-Trees on the structured panel only; opening bid with an error bar* · vuelta 1

Expert 1 here — the classifier that reads the structured panel and nothing else. My bid:

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.63
  uncertainty  +/- 0.13 epistemic (95% band 0.37-0.89); among patients I cannot tell apart the outcome was 0.95 of 1.00 mixed
  reliability  LOW ('discuss' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 55% of the time over the 38 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most, across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, PI-RADS >= 4, no prior biopsy, pmhx_hypercholesterolaemia, suspicious DRE, number of comorbidities. I read 39 variables, all
from the panel — nothing from the mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the
laboratory. Out-of-fold over 91 labelled cases: AUC 0.758, balanced
accuracy 0.625.

The final call is the chair's.

## Intervención 4 — EXPERT-COHORT

*cohort criterion; what the labelled series did in this exact situation* · vuelta 1

This patient's situation: prior positive biopsy. The panel alone does not answer, and that is the finding.

The criterion here is that the visible panel does not determine this decision: he already has a tissue diagnosis, so neither a high PI-RADS nor a rising PSA is new information. What decides it is the documented grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance history, which live in the previous notes. Measured on the labelled series: none of the three panel
rules I carry for this situation (PSA >= 20, age >= 78, PI-RADS <= 2) applies to him, and among the
39 remaining labelled men in this situation no structured variable separates the two answers.

REGISTRAR: the previous notes are where this case is decided. Read them for the grade of the prior
biopsy (Gleason or ISUP), the number of biopsy sessions and their dates, and whether he is on a
surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due. Do not read this as 'defer' and do not read it
as 'biopsy'.

## Intervención 5 — EXPERT-LIBRARY

*case library; the closest labelled precedents and what the reading urologist did with them* · vuelta 1

The case library holds 48 labelled men in this same situation (Positive prior biopsy). The 3 closest by panel distance, and what the reading urologist did:
  1. distance 1.12: PI-RADS 5, PSA 5.5, PSAD 0.12, age 71, DRE Normal -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "Prev biopsy finding is left lobe, MRI finding highly suspicious of ISUP≥2 on right side. Active surveillance, only 1 biopsy session performed (of unclear date and unclea…"
  2. distance 1.53: PI-RADS 5, PSA 10.0, PSAD 0.27, age 75, DRE Normal -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "New(? -> no old MRI report included) PIRADS 5 and rising PSA makes biopsy necessary"
  3. distance 1.78: PI-RADS 5, PSA 19.0, PSAD 0.37, age 65, DRE Normal -> DEFER (clear). He wrote: "Patient needs treatment without repeat biopsy as earlier biopsy showed ISUP4"

PRECEDENT: BIOPSY (weighted vote 0.73 for biopsy). Distance-weighted precedent is no better than chance here (0.47 leave-one-out): read the precedents for how this urologist reasons, not for the answer.

What the precedents are FOR: they show what this urologist looks at and how he phrases the call. What they are NOT: facts about this patient. Nobody may cite a precedent's grade, PSA or MRI as if it were his.

## Intervención 6 — EXPERT-TRACE

*Expert 4, trace model; which documents the reading urologist opens and what he weighs in this situation* · vuelta 1

Expert 4 here — the model of how the reading urologist works a case like this. Predicted from his 48 labelled traces in this situation (Positive prior biopsy): a per-field model where it beats the mode out of fold (prior-biopsy weight, DRE weight, PI-RADS weight, and whether he opens the laboratory), the mode elsewhere.

WHAT HE OPENS: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes.
WHAT HE WEIGHS: bx=important, fh=noted, age=important, dre=noted, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=important, comorbidity=noted.
HOW SURE HE USUALLY IS: clear.

MODERATOR: that list of documents is the plan — exactly those, no more. Every document opened beyond what
he would open is scored against the conference as an unnecessary reveal; every document left closed
leaves a variable he weighed without its source. Attach the question each one must answer.

## Intervención 7 — EXPERT-EAU

*EAU guideline specialist; speaks only from the guideline text he retrieved* · vuelta 1

GUIDELINE
The guideline addresses the need for repeat biopsy when there is a lesion on MRI and the need for repeat PSA testing. "sion on MRI mandates a repeat biopsy to confirm histological progression before a change in treatment strategy." This requires confirmation of histological progression before changing treatment.

WHAT THE EXPERTS' BIDS DO NOT SETTLE
EXPERT-STRUCTURED, I find the panel variables do not settle the decision because the guideline emphasizes that the decision hinges on histological progression or specific MRI findings, which are not fully captured by the panel variables alone. EXPERT-COHORT, the criterion that the visible panel does not determine this decision because the documented grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance history are the deciding factors, which are not explicitly resolved by the panel rules.

WHAT THE DOCUMENTS MUST SETTLE
previous_notes - the grade of the prior biopsy: at ISUP 2 or above the guideline sends him to treatment, not to more tissue; if it is unrecorded the indication stands
radiology_report - whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study: unchanged does not support re-sampling, new or larger does
psa_trend - whether the PSA has normalized: if the PSA has normalised, a new PSA test can be performed after one year
laboratory_results - whether the PSA has normalized: the type of PSA assay used may impact PSA values and rates of PSA above certain fixed thresholds

## Intervención 8 — MODERATOR

*chairs the discussion; sets the open questions and assigns the documents* · vuelta 1

This case hinges on establishing the grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance status documented in the previous notes.

The documents for this session were fixed by EXPERT-TRACE; what I add is the question each one has to answer, and the open questions for the room.

REGISTRAR — pull these up, and answer exactly the question attached to each:
  radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Does the lesion on MRI need to be compared against an earlier study?
  psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> Has the PSA normalized?
  previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> What is the grade of the prior biopsy, and is there a surveillance protocol in place?

OPEN QUESTIONS for this conference — these are what the decision hangs on:
  Q1. What is the documented grade (Gleason/ISUP) of the prior prostate biopsy?
  Q2. Is the patient currently on a surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due?

## Intervención 9 — REGISTRAR

*the registrar who pulls up documents; reports what they say, nothing else* · vuelta 1

WHAT I FOUND
radiology_report
COMPARISON: new
LESION: size and zone of the index lesion, as the report words it: "A focal lesion occupies the left peripheral zone at the base/mid-gland level, spanning approximately 28 mm in maximum dimension."

psa_trend
Has the PSA normalized?: No, the PSA trend shows a rise from 10.2 (Dec 2022) to 11.0 (Feb 2025).

previous_notes
What is the grade of the prior biopsy, and is there a surveillance protocol in place?: The previous notes mention a "previously positive prostate biopsy bucket recording Gleason 3+4 pathology," and there is no mention of a surveillance protocol in place.

WHAT I DID NOT OPEN
laboratory_results, family-history anamnesis, and the pathology report were not opened because the previous notes provided the necessary information regarding the prior biopsy status, and the other requested documents did not contain information that would alter the interpretation of the open questions.

WHAT THIS SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now
PI-RADS 5 lesion in the left peripheral zone (base/mid), consistent with high probability of clinically significant prostate cancer.
PSA velocity of 2.49 ng/mL/yr indicates a significant rise in PSA.

AGAINST sampling this patient now
The previous notes state there is no mention of a surveillance protocol in place.

WHERE THIS LEANS
LEAN: biopsy

## Intervención 10 — EXPERT-PSA

*Expert 2, PSA projector; the trajectory behind the headline PSA, with a conformal band* · vuelta 1

Expert 2 here — the PSA projector. I read only the serial PSA the registrar opened.

TRAJECTORY: RISING (borderline). Last value 11.00 ng/mL over 4 points spanning 26 months; velocity -0.19 ng/mL per year; no meaningful doubling time.
PROJECTION at 6 months: 24.0 ng/mL, conformal 95% band 6.9-83.7.

Read the band before the point: it is wide by construction, and I only call a direction when the whole
band clears the last value. This does not vote on the biopsy — a rising PSA in a man with a known
diagnosis is the disease behaving as known — it tells the chair how fast the number is moving.

## Intervención 11 — EXPERT-FUSION

*Expert 3, Extra-Trees on panel + laboratory + MRI prose; speaks only on documents that were opened* · vuelta 1

Expert 3 here — the fusion classifier. I read the panel, the mpMRI report — the laboratory panel was not opened, so that block is imputed and my band is wider for it; nothing from the previous notes or the PSA series.

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.63
  uncertainty  +/- 0.14 epistemic (95% band 0.36-0.89), of which 0.01 comes from values that had to be imputed
  reliability  LOW ('discuss' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 59% of the time over the 29 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, no prior biopsy, free PSA < 15%, DWI restriction in the report, lesion >= 15 mm in the report, suspicious DRE. Out-of-fold AUC 0.794. I am the only expert that has read the report's wording, and I still cannot see the prior grade or the
surveillance history: those are in the notes, and the registrar has to carry them.

## Intervención 12 — PANEL-PROTOCOL

*the panel's written protocol; consolidates the experts by rule and says which rule fired* · vuelta 1

The panel protocol, applied to what is on the board:

  EXPERT-STRUCTURED  BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.63  ('discuss' tier; weight 1.0)
  EXPERT-FUSION      BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.63  ('discuss' tier, fusion_nolab; weight 1.5)
  EXPERT-LIBRARY     BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.73  (k=3 precedents; does not vote)

  documented prior grade in the opened documents: none recorded

RULE THAT FIRED: weighted vote of the trained experts, p = 0.63 — carried by weighted panel.
PANEL ANSWER: BIOPSY. EXPERT-FUSION carried the most weight ('discuss' tier, fusion_nolab). In this bucket no rule applied and the documents did not record the prior grade, so the trained experts decide.

Confidence the trace model expects here: borderline. Weights it expects: bx=important, fh=noted, age=important, dre=noted, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=important, comorbidity=noted.

CHAIR: this is the panel's position. You sign it, and you write why in the room's words — naming what the registrar retrieved. If you believe a retrieved finding overturns it, name that finding with its value; the burden is on the finding, not on the panel.

## Intervención 13 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

SUFFICIENCY
The documents retrieved by the registrar—the radiology report, PSA trend, and previous notes—directly address the moderator's questions regarding the prior biopsy grade and surveillance status.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE PANEL
The panel protocol concluded with a weighted vote for BIOPSY based on the experts' consensus, which is consistent with the findings that the prior grade was not recorded in the opened documents.

THE OPEN QUESTIONS, ONE BY ONE
Q1. What is the documented grade (Gleason/ISUP) of the prior prostate biopsy? Answered by the previous notes: "Gleason 3+4 pathology." Q2. Is the patient currently on a surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due? Answered by the previous notes: "no mention of a surveillance protocol in place."

WHAT CARRIES WEIGHT, AND WHY
The documented prior biopsy grade (Gleason 3+4) and the absence of a surveillance protocol are the most critical variables because the EAU guideline emphasizes that the decision hinges on histological progression or the documented grade of the prior biopsy.

MY SUGGESTION TO THE CHAIR
Given the prior positive biopsy with a Gleason 3+4 finding and no documented surveillance protocol, the guideline suggests treatment rather than further tissue sampling. I suggest proceeding with biopsy.

VERDICT: ready | SUGGEST: biopsy | MISSING: none

[The conference closes after pass 1: the verifier called the record ready. The chair decides on the record as it stands.]

## Intervención 14 — CHAIR

*the senior urologist who signs the decision* · vuelta 1

MY DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: borderline)

70y/PSA 11.0/PSAD 0.108/PI-RADS 5, prior biopsy positive with unrecorded grade. Rising PSA and new MRI lesion mandate repeat biopsy to confirm histological progression before treatment change. Lack of prior grade prevents definitive risk stratification.

What carried weight: bx=important, age=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=important, comorbidity=noted
Sections retrieved: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes
