## Intervención 2 — INTAKE

*the record clerk; reads the file out loud and interprets nothing* · vuelta 1

And this is the same record as the reading form presents it — the panel the urologist sees up front, with the masked documents named but not shown.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_c9d31197c533
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 02 Feb 2025.
Referrer: Dr. R. Visser (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 61-year-old male
  - PSA: 10.92 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 5 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.26 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 1.16 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 10.0 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 42.0 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 1
  - DRE findings: Nodus (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.8727174 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Hypertension, Osteoarthritis
  - Problem list / PMHx: Hypertension, Osteoarthritis
  - Current medication: valsartan, lisinopril, paracetamol PRN
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 10.92 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 0.26. Prostate volume 42 mL. DRE nodus. csPCa 0.87.

Vitals: weight 73 kg, height 172 cm, BMI 24.7, BP 125/92 mmHg, HR 75 bpm. Smoking: Non-smoker.

Chief complaint: Persistent PSA elevation and confirmation of Gleason 4+3 carcinoma on prior biopsy bucket "Positive" warrant clinical reassessment.

History: A 61-year-old retired bank clerk entered the diagnostic pathway in late 2023 due to elevated PSA levels. He is a non-smoker with a background of hypertension treated by valsartan and lisinopril, plus osteoarthritis managed with paracetamol PRN. Divorced, he resides in an assisted-living facility and enjoys tennis twice weekly, averaging 22 units of alcohol each week. With his daughter handling correspondence under consent, he recently completed baseline memory screening and a sleep clinic assessment for suspected obstructive sleep apnoea. A prior 12-core biopsy confirmed Gleason 4+3 disease. He experiences chronic lower urinary tract symptoms yielding an IPSS of 20/35, yet denies urinary retention, haematuria, unexplained weight loss, or bone pain. His overall condition remains stable.

Physical examination: DRE — texture: moderately enlarged gland with a firm, discrete nodule palpable in the left peripheral zone; remainder symmetrically smooth without induration. General examination shows stable vital signs, unremarkable systemic findings, and no palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

Patient info: retired bank clerk; Divorced; Lives in assisted-living facility.
Next of kin: Nephew.

Lifestyle: alcohol 22 units / week; exercise Tennis 2x/week; IPSS score: 20/35 (severe LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Memory clinic — baseline screening; Sleep clinic — suspected obstructive sleep apnoea.
Admin: Daughter manages communication; CC on letters with patient consent.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


One correction to that last paragraph before anybody acts on it: the documents this task actually serves are radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results, plus the family-history anamnesis. There is NO pathology report to pull up in a task-1 biopsy decision — the prior-biopsy status on the panel above is all the pathology on record, and whatever the previous notes say about it. Nobody should ask for one, and nobody should quote one.

## Intervención 3 — EXPERT-STRUCTURED

*Expert 1, Extra-Trees on the structured panel only; opening bid with an error bar* · vuelta 1

Expert 1 here — the classifier that reads the structured panel and nothing else. My bid:

SUGGESTION: NO BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.36
  uncertainty  +/- 0.12 epistemic (95% band 0.12-0.60); among patients I cannot tell apart the outcome was 0.94 of 1.00 mixed
  reliability  MODERATE ('supports' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 60% of the time over the 20 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most, across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, PI-RADS >= 4, no prior biopsy, pmhx_hypercholesterolaemia, suspicious DRE, number of comorbidities. I read 39 variables, all
from the panel — nothing from the mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the
laboratory. Out-of-fold over 91 labelled cases: AUC 0.758, balanced
accuracy 0.625.

The final call is the chair's.

## Intervención 4 — EXPERT-COHORT

*cohort criterion; what the labelled series did in this exact situation* · vuelta 1

This patient's situation: prior positive biopsy. The panel alone does not answer, and that is the finding.

The criterion here is that the visible panel does not determine this decision: he already has a tissue diagnosis, so neither a high PI-RADS nor a rising PSA is new information. What decides it is the documented grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance history, which live in the previous notes. Measured on the labelled series: none of the three panel
rules I carry for this situation (PSA >= 20, age >= 78, PI-RADS <= 2) applies to him, and among the
39 remaining labelled men in this situation no structured variable separates the two answers.

REGISTRAR: the previous notes are where this case is decided. Read them for the grade of the prior
biopsy (Gleason or ISUP), the number of biopsy sessions and their dates, and whether he is on a
surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due. Do not read this as 'defer' and do not read it
as 'biopsy'.

## Intervención 5 — EXPERT-LIBRARY

*case library; the closest labelled precedents and what the reading urologist did with them* · vuelta 1

The case library holds 48 labelled men in this same situation (Positive prior biopsy). The 3 closest by panel distance, and what the reading urologist did:
  1. distance 0.81: PI-RADS 5, PSA 8.3, PSAD 0.215, age 66, DRE Suspicious -> DEFER (clear). He wrote: "This person should discuss curative treatment (younger patient with palpable, MRI-visible high-risk disease incl Gleason 5 findings). If not curative treatment for any r…"
  2. distance 1.07: PI-RADS 5, PSA 8.6, PSAD 0.202, age 68, DRE Nodus -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "Patient reasonable to discuss curative treatment with (age 68, no very dramatic comorbidity, unfavorable intermediate risk disease). Considering he chose not curative tr…"
  3. distance 1.11: PI-RADS 5, PSA 6.9, PSAD 0.171, age 67, DRE Nodus -> DEFER (borderline). He wrote: "Need to know if the P5 lesion has grown in size. If not no biopsy."

PRECEDENT: DEFER (weighted vote 0.31 for biopsy). Distance-weighted precedent is no better than chance here (0.47 leave-one-out): read the precedents for how this urologist reasons, not for the answer.

What the precedents are FOR: they show what this urologist looks at and how he phrases the call. What they are NOT: facts about this patient. Nobody may cite a precedent's grade, PSA or MRI as if it were his.

## Intervención 6 — EXPERT-TRACE

*Expert 4, trace model; which documents the reading urologist opens and what he weighs in this situation* · vuelta 1

Expert 4 here — the model of how the reading urologist works a case like this. Predicted from his 48 labelled traces in this situation (Positive prior biopsy): a per-field model where it beats the mode out of fold (prior-biopsy weight, DRE weight, PI-RADS weight, and whether he opens the laboratory), the mode elsewhere.

WHAT HE OPENS: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results.
WHAT HE WEIGHS: bx=important, fh=noted, age=important, dre=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=important, comorbidity=noted.
HOW SURE HE USUALLY IS: clear.

MODERATOR: that list of documents is the plan — exactly those, no more. Every document opened beyond what
he would open is scored against the conference as an unnecessary reveal; every document left closed
leaves a variable he weighed without its source. Attach the question each one must answer.

## Intervención 7 — EXPERT-EAU

*EAU guideline specialist; speaks only from the guideline text he retrieved* · vuelta 1

GUIDELINE
The guideline discusses using a risk-adapted matrix based on PI-RADS score and PSA density to guide the decision to perform a biopsy. "This risk-adapted matrix table may guide the decision to perform a biopsy." It also notes that in a risk-based pathway, biopsy could have been avoided in 99 men while missing ISUP GG 2 cancers in only six men.

WHAT THE EXPERTS' BIDS DO NOT SETTLE
EXPERT-STRUCTURED, your suggestion of no biopsy is not decisive because the guideline suggests a risk-adapted matrix should be used, which incorporates variables like PI-RADS and PSA density. EXPERT-COHORT, the cohort criterion is insufficient because the guideline indicates that the decision is not determined by simple panel rules, and the prior positive biopsy status is a key factor that must be weighed against surveillance history.

WHAT THE DOCUMENTS MUST SETTLE
previous_notes - the documented grade of the prior biopsy: at ISUP 2 or above the guideline sends him to treatment, not to more tissue; if it is unrecorded the indication stands
radiology_report - whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study: unchanged does not support re-sampling, new or larger does
psa_trend - the PSA velocity: the guideline suggests that PSA velocity is a factor in risk stratification.
laboratory_results - the PSA density: the guideline links PSA density to the risk-adapted matrix for biopsy decisions.

## Intervención 8 — MODERATOR

*chairs the discussion; sets the open questions and assigns the documents* · vuelta 1

This case hinges on the documented grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance plan detailed in the previous notes.

The documents for this session were fixed by EXPERT-TRACE; what I add is the question each one has to answer, and the open questions for the room.

REGISTRAR — pull these up, and answer exactly the question attached to each:
  radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Does the lesion size or status compared against an earlier study influence the decision?
  psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> Does the PSA velocity factor into the risk stratification?
  previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> What is the documented grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance history?
  laboratory_results (get_lab_results) -> Does the PSA density factor into the risk-adapted matrix for biopsy decisions?

OPEN QUESTIONS for this conference — these are what the decision hangs on:
  Q1. What is the documented grade (Gleason/ISUP) of the prior biopsy?
  Q2. Is the patient on a surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due?

## Intervención 9 — REGISTRAR

*the registrar who pulls up documents; reports what they say, nothing else* · vuelta 1

WHAT I FOUND
radiology_report
COMPARISON: new
LESION: size approximately 18 x 14 x 12 mm, in the left peripheral zone.

psa_trend
Does the PSA velocity factor into the risk stratification?
The PSA velocity is shown as rising from 4.5 (Dec 2023) to 10.92 (Feb 2025), indicating a rising trend.

previous_notes
What is the documented grade of the prior biopsy and the surveillance history?
The documented grade of the prior biopsy is Gleason 4+3 disease, and no surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due is recorded.

laboratory_results
Does the PSA density factor into the risk-adapted matrix for biopsy decisions?
The PSA density is 0.26 ng/mL/mL, which is a factor in the risk-adapted matrix.

WHAT I DID NOT OPEN
family-history anamnesis, because the previous notes already detailed the relevant history.

WHAT THIS SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now
PI-RADS 5 lesion in the left peripheral zone, indicating high suspicion.
PSA velocity is rising, which is a factor in risk stratification.

AGAINST sampling this patient now
The documented grade of the prior biopsy is Gleason 4+3 disease, which is a known outcome.

WHERE THIS LEANS
LEAN: biopsy

## Intervención 10 — EXPERT-PSA

*Expert 2, PSA projector; the trajectory behind the headline PSA, with a conformal band* · vuelta 1

Expert 2 here — the PSA projector. I read only the serial PSA the registrar opened.

TRAJECTORY: INDETERMINATE (uncertain). Last value 10.92 ng/mL over 5 points spanning 14 months; velocity +5.47 ng/mL per year; doubling time about 11 months.
PROJECTION at 6 months: 13.4 ng/mL, conformal 95% band 3.9-46.8.

Read the band before the point: it is wide by construction, and I only call a direction when the whole
band clears the last value. This does not vote on the biopsy — a rising PSA in a man with a known
diagnosis is the disease behaving as known — it tells the chair how fast the number is moving.

## Intervención 11 — EXPERT-FUSION

*Expert 3, Extra-Trees on panel + laboratory + MRI prose; speaks only on documents that were opened* · vuelta 1

Expert 3 here — the fusion classifier. I read the panel, the mpMRI report and the laboratory panel; nothing from the previous notes or the PSA series.

SUGGESTION: NO BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.27
  uncertainty  +/- 0.12 epistemic (95% band 0.03-0.50), of which 0.00 comes from values that had to be imputed
  reliability  MODERATE ('supports' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 71% of the time over the 24 labelled cases in this tier

What moved me most across the labelled series: prior positive biopsy, no prior biopsy, free PSA < 15%, DWI restriction in the report, lesion >= 15 mm in the report, suspicious DRE. Out-of-fold AUC 0.794. I am the only expert that has read the report's wording, and I still cannot see the prior grade or the
surveillance history: those are in the notes, and the registrar has to carry them.

## Intervención 12 — PANEL-PROTOCOL

*the panel's written protocol; consolidates the experts by rule and says which rule fired* · vuelta 1

The panel protocol, applied to what is on the board:

  EXPERT-STRUCTURED  DEFER, p(biopsy)=0.36  ('supports' tier; weight 2.0)
  EXPERT-FUSION      DEFER, p(biopsy)=0.27  ('supports' tier, fusion_full; weight 3.0)
  EXPERT-LIBRARY     DEFER, p(biopsy)=0.31  (k=3 precedents; does not vote)

  documented prior grade in the opened documents: GG 3 ("Gleason 4+3")

RULE THAT FIRED: documented prior grade GG 3 (Gleason 4+3) — carried by documented grade.
PANEL ANSWER: NO BIOPSY. A documented grade group of 2 or more is a treatment problem, not a sampling problem: the reading urologist deferred re-biopsy in 7 of the 8 labelled men with a recorded GG >= 2.

Confidence the trace model expects here: clear. Weights it expects: bx=important, fh=noted, age=important, dre=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=important, comorbidity=noted.

CHAIR: this is the panel's position. You sign it, and you write why in the room's words — naming what the registrar retrieved. If you believe a retrieved finding overturns it, name that finding with its value; the burden is on the finding, not on the panel.

## Intervención 13 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

SUFFICIENCY
The documents retrieved by the registrar appear to have answered both open questions. The `previous_notes` stated the documented grade was Gleason 4+3 disease, and it explicitly stated "no surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due is recorded," answering Q1 and Q2.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE PANEL
The retrieved finding, the documented prior grade of Gleason 4+3 disease, aligns directly with the PANEL-PROTOCOL's decision of NO BIOPSY, as the protocol states that a documented grade group of 2 or more is a treatment problem, not a sampling problem.

THE OPEN QUESTIONS, ONE BY ONE
Q1. What is the documented grade (Gleason/ISUP) of the prior biopsy? Answered by the `previous_notes`: Gleason 4+3 disease.
Q2. Is the patient on a surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due? Answered by the `previous_notes`: No surveillance protocol with a confirmatory biopsy due is recorded.

WHAT CARRIES WEIGHT, AND WHY
The documented prior biopsy grade (Gleason 4+3) is the most critical variable because the PANEL-PROTOCOL explicitly states this finding is the rule that fired, indicating that the known outcome dictates the management pathway over other risk factors.

MY SUGGESTION TO THE CHAIR
I suggest the decision should stand as NO BIOPSY, firmly based on the documented prior Gleason 4+3 diagnosis, which is the explicit rule that determined the PANEL-PROTOCOL's answer.

VERDICT: ready | SUGGEST: defer | MISSING: none

[The conference closes after pass 1: the verifier called the record ready. The chair decides on the record as it stands.]

## Intervención 14 — CHAIR

*the senior urologist who signs the decision* · vuelta 1

MY DECISION: NO BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

61y male, PSA 10.92, PSAD 0.26, PI-RADS 5, prior biopsy Gleason 4+3. Disease is characterized by prior tissue diagnosis, so repeat biopsy is not indicated. The PI-RADS 5 finding is expected given the known cancer status. No earlier MRI to compare with.

What carried weight: bx=important, age=important, dre=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=important, comorbidity=noted
