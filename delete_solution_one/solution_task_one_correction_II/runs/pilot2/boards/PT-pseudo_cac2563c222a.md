## Intervención 2 — INTAKE

*the record clerk; reads the file out loud and interprets nothing* · vuelta 1

And this is the same record as the reading form presents it — the panel the urologist sees up front, with the masked documents named but not shown.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_cac2563c222a
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 28 Feb 2025.
Referrer: Dr. F. de Boer (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 50-year-old male
  - PSA: 4.53 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 5 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.12 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 0.54 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 4.1 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 41.0 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 3
  - DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.84312165 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Not reported
  - Problem list / PMHx: none recorded
  - Current medication: None
  - Allergies: NSAIDs
  - Additional notes: PSA 4.53 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 0.12. Prostate volume 41 mL. csPCa 0.84.

Vitals: weight 86 kg, height 182 cm, BMI 26.0, BP 143/64 mmHg, HR 64 bpm. Smoking: Non-smoker.

Chief complaint: Assessment requested to review a previous prostate biopsy alongside a steadily climbing PSA curve.

History: A 50-year-old freelance translator residing with his wife came under scrutiny after a PSA elevation emerged in mid-2023. He denies any lower urinary tract complaints, recording an IPSS of 1 out of 35, and reports no pelvic discomfort or blood in the urine. A non-smoker, he drinks roughly 26 alcoholic units each week and stays physically active through weekend hiking excursions. Unrelated recent visits included a dermatology check for actinic keratosis monitoring and a routine flu shot given by the practice nurse. He has never undergone major operations, uses no daily prescriptions, and handles remote work using enlarged print because of mild vision loss. Despite some mild worry about the PSA curve, he feels otherwise healthy. The prior biopsy bucket is Positive.

Physical examination: DRE — texture: smooth and symmetrically normal; mobility: unrestricted; asymmetry: absent. General inspection shows stable vital signs, clear peripheral lymph nodes, and no skeletal tenderness. Abdominal palpation confirms a soft, non-tender cavity devoid of masses.

Patient info: freelance translator; Married; Lives with partner.
Next of kin: Spouse / partner (primary contact).

Lifestyle: alcohol 26 units / week; exercise Hiking on weekends; IPSS score: 1/35 (mild LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Dermatology — actinic keratosis check; GP practice nurse — flu vaccination.
Admin: Visual impairment: large-print correspondence requested.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


One correction to that last paragraph before anybody acts on it: the documents this task actually serves are radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results, plus the family-history anamnesis. There is NO pathology report to pull up in a task-1 biopsy decision — the prior-biopsy status on the panel above is all the pathology on record. Nobody should ask for one, and nobody should quote one.

## Intervención 3 — EXPERT-CLASSIFIER

*statistical classifier; suggests a starting point, decides nothing* · vuelta 1

A classifier trained only to open the discussion, not to close it. Here is its bid.

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.55
  uncertainty  +/- 0.17 (95% CI 0.21-0.88); among patients it cannot tell apart the outcome was 0.99 of 1.00 mixed
  confidence   LOW — in this tier it was right 49% of the time over 43 labelled cases — barely better than a coin, so treat it as an opening bid and nothing more

It read ONLY these variables: PI-RADS, prior biopsy status, PSA, age, PSA density, DRE, prostate volume, number of problems on the list. Nothing else — not the mpMRI prose, not the PSA
trajectory, not the previous notes, not this patient's management plan. Values it could not
read for this patient: none.
Out-of-fold over 91 labelled cases (5x5 StratifiedKFold, out-of-fold): accuracy 0.714 against a
majority-class baseline of 0.615, AUC 0.789, F1(yes) 0.78.

The final call is the senior urologist's.

## Intervención 4 — EXPERT-COHORT

*cohort criterion; what the labelled series did in this exact situation* · vuelta 1

This patient's situation: prior positive biopsy. I have no answer for him, and that is the finding.

The criterion here is that the visible panel does not determine this decision: the man already has a tissue diagnosis, so neither a high PI-RADS nor a rising PSA is new information. Measured on the 49 labelled cases in this
situation: no structured variable separates the two answers — PSA is rising in all 49 — the
split is 26 defer / 23 biopsy, and every rule fitted on one half failed on the other.

Do not read this as 'defer' and do not read it as 'biopsy'. It means the panel cannot settle
this man and the retrieved documents have to.

## Intervención 5 — EXPERT-EAU

*EAU guideline specialist; speaks only from the guideline text he retrieved* · vuelta 1

GUIDELINE
The guideline suggests that a repeat biopsy after a negative biopsy should be considered dependent on risk factors such as PSA density and PI-RADS score. It states, "follow-up or direct repeat biopsy should be considered dependant of risk factors (e.g. PSA density, PI-RADS score)."

WHAT THE CLASSIFIER'S BID DOES NOT SETTLE
The classifier's suggestion of biopsy is not sufficiently grounded in the guideline because it fails to account for the specific thresholds the guideline sets. The guideline requires consideration of variables like PSA density and PI-RADS score to determine the need for a repeat biopsy, which the classifier's bid did not incorporate into its decision-making process.

WHAT WE STILL NEED
The mpMRI prose - the mpMRI prose does not compare against an earlier study, so the guideline does not support re-sampling based on imaging alone.
The prior biopsy status - the prior biopsy status is positive, which is a key factor that the guideline uses to guide the decision pathway.
The laboratory value that is not the PSA - the PSA density (0.12 ng/mL²) is a variable the guideline makes decisive that the classifier could not read, which is necessary to assess the need for a repeat biopsy.

## Intervención 6 — MODERATOR

*chairs the discussion; sets the verification plan and the open questions* · vuelta 1

This case hinges on whether the specific combination of the PI-RADS score, the PSA density, and the prior positive biopsy warrants a repeat biopsy according to the EAU guidelines.

Before anyone argues, this is what I want established, and by whom.

REGISTRAR — pull these up, and answer exactly the question attached to each:
  radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Determine if the mpMRI prose compares the current findings against an earlier study.
  previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> Review the management context and any prior agreements regarding surveillance.
  psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> What shape does the serial PSA have — rising, flat, falling or oscillating — and over what period?

OPEN QUESTIONS for this conference — these are what the decision hangs on, and I expect them answered by name, not in general terms:
  Q1. Does the mpMRI prose indicate whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study?

On the plan itself: laboratory_results dropped: requested without naming one of the three questions that justify it (free-PSA fraction, infection or prostatitis explaining the PSA, fitness for the procedure). The DRE and the headline PSA are already on the panel. psa_trend was added to the plan: the reading urologist opened it in 87% of the labelled cases, and it carries a fact this decision turns on. Dropped 1 question(s) that asked for a value already printed on the panel: "How should the prior positive biopsy status, in conjunction with the PSA density, influence the decision for a repeat biopsy?" — the room can read it off intervention 1.

## Intervención 7 — REGISTRAR

*the registrar who pulls up documents; reports what they say, nothing else* · vuelta 1

WHAT I FOUND
radiology_report
The mpMRI prose does not compare against an earlier study.
previous_notes
The management context is that the earlier biopsy established Gleason 3+3 disease, and an ongoing surveillance plan was documented.
psa_trend
The serial PSA has been rising from 3.3 ng/mL in Jun 2023 to 4.53 ng/mL in Feb 2025.

WHAT I DID NOT OPEN
I did not open laboratory_results because the moderator did not ask for a specific value from that panel to justify its inclusion in the decision.

WHAT THIS SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now
The rising PSA trend supports further investigation.
The PI-RADS 5 score on the mpMRI suggests a high-risk lesion.
AGAINST sampling this patient now
The prior biopsy status is positive, meaning a tissue diagnosis already exists.

WHERE THIS LEANS
The combination of a rising PSA trend and a high-risk PI-RADS 5 lesion, despite a prior positive biopsy, leans toward further tissue characterization.
LEAN: biopsy

## Intervención 8 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

SUFFICIENCY
The registrar answered the moderator's first question by stating that the mpMRI prose does not compare against an earlier study.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE CLASSIFIER
The retrieved evidence, specifically the rising PSA trend and the PI-RADS 5 score, aligns with the Expert-Classifier's suggestion of BIOPSY, as the classifier suggested biopsy based on the available variables.

THE OPEN QUESTIONS, ONE BY ONE
Q1. Does the mpMRI prose indicate whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study? Answered by the registrar, who stated the mpMRI prose does not compare against an earlier study.
Q2. Review the management context and any prior agreements regarding surveillance. Answered by the registrar, who stated the management context is that the earlier biopsy established Gleason 3+3 disease, and an ongoing surveillance plan was documented.
Q3. What shape does the serial PSA have — rising, flat, falling or oscillating — and over what period? Answered by the registrar, who stated the serial PSA has been rising from 3.3 ng/mL in Jun 2023 to 4.53 ng/mL in Feb 2025.

WHAT CARRIES WEIGHT, AND WHY
The two most relevant variables are the rising PSA trend, which supports further investigation, and the PI-RADS 5 score, which suggests a high-risk lesion. The prior positive biopsy status is a variable the guideline makes decisive, but the rising trend and high score push toward further characterization. The guideline does not explicitly support the leaning toward biopsy when the prior biopsy is positive.

MY SUGGESTION TO THE CHAIR
I suggest proceeding with a biopsy to further characterize the lesion, given the combination of a rising PSA trend and a high-risk PI-RADS 5 score, despite the prior positive biopsy.

VERDICT: ready | SUGGEST: biopsy | MISSING: none

[The conference closes after pass 1: the verifier called the record ready. The chair decides on the record as it stands.]

## Intervención 9 — CHAIR

*the senior urologist who signs the decision* · vuelta 1

MY DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

Despite the prior positive biopsy, the combination of a rising PSA trend from 3.3 to 4.53 ng/mL and a high-risk PI-RADS 5 score warrants further tissue characterization. The rising PSA trend and high PI-RADS score push toward further characterization, overriding the prior diagnosis alone. The room converged on proceeding with a biopsy to further characterize the lesion.
