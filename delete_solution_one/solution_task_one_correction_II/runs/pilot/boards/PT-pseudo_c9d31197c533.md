## Intervención 2 — INTAKE

*the record clerk; reads the file out loud and interprets nothing* · vuelta 1

And this is the same record as the reading form presents it — the panel the urologist sees up front, with the masked documents named but not shown.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_c9d31197c533

  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 10.92 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 0.26. Prostate volume 42 mL. DRE nodus. csPCa 0.87.

Vitals: weight 73 kg, height 172 cm, BMI 24.7, BP 125/92 mmHg, HR 75 bpm. Smoking: Non-smoker.

Chief complaint: Persistent PSA elevation and confirmation of Gleason 4+3 carcinoma on prior biopsy bucket "Positive" warrant clinical reassessment.

History: A 61-year-old retired bank clerk entered the diagnostic pathway in late 2023 due to elevated PSA levels. He is a non-smoker with a background of hypertension treated by valsartan and lisinopril, plus osteoarthritis managed with paracetamol PRN. Divorced, he resides in an assisted-living facility and enjoys tennis twice weekly, averaging 22 units of alcohol each week. With his daughter handling correspondence under consent, he recently completed baseline memory screening and a sleep clinic assessment for suspected obstructive sleep apnoea. A prior 12-core biopsy confirmed Gleason 4+3 disease. He experiences chronic lower urinary tract symptoms yielding an IPSS of 20/35, yet denies urinary retention, haematuria, unexplained weight loss, or bone pain. His overall condition remains stable.

Physical examination: DRE — texture: moderately enlarged gland with a firm, discrete nodule palpable in the left peripheral zone; remainder symmetrically smooth without induration. General examination shows stable vital signs, unremarkable systemic findings, and no palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

Patient info: retired bank clerk; Divorced; Lives in assisted-living facility.
Next of kin: Nephew.

Lifestyle: alcohol 22 units / week; exercise Tennis 2x/week; IPSS score: 20/35 (severe LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Memory clinic — baseline screening; Sleep clinic — suspected obstructive sleep apnoea.
Admin: Daughter manages communication; CC on letters with patient consent.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


One correction to that last paragraph before anybody acts on it: the documents this task actually serves are radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results, plus the family-history anamnesis. There is NO pathology report to pull up in a task-1 biopsy decision — the prior-biopsy status on the panel above is all the pathology on record. Nobody should ask for one, and nobody should quote one.

## Intervención 3 — EXPERT-CLASSIFIER

*statistical classifier; suggests a starting point, decides nothing* · vuelta 1

A classifier trained only to open the discussion, not to close it. Here is its bid.

SUGGESTION: NO BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.40
  uncertainty  +/- 0.17 (95% CI 0.08-0.73); among patients it cannot tell apart the outcome was 0.97 of 1.00 mixed
  confidence   LOW — in this tier it was right 49% of the time over 43 labelled cases — barely better than a coin, so treat it as an opening bid and nothing more

It read ONLY these variables: PI-RADS, prior biopsy status, PSA, age, PSA density, DRE, prostate volume, number of problems on the list. Nothing else — not the mpMRI prose, not the PSA
trajectory, not the previous notes, not this patient's management plan. Values it could not
read for this patient: none.
Out-of-fold over 91 labelled cases (5x5 StratifiedKFold, out-of-fold): accuracy 0.714 against a
majority-class baseline of 0.615, AUC 0.789, F1(yes) 0.78.

The final call is the senior urologist's.

## Intervención 4 — EXPERT-COHORT

*cohort criterion; what the labelled series did in this exact situation* · vuelta 1

This patient's situation: prior positive biopsy. I have no answer for him, and that is the finding.

The criterion here is that the visible panel does not determine this decision: the man already has a tissue diagnosis, so neither a high PI-RADS nor a rising PSA is new information. Measured on the 49 labelled cases in this
situation: no structured variable separates the two answers — PSA is rising in all 49 — the
split is 26 defer / 23 biopsy, and every rule fitted on one half failed on the other.

Do not read this as 'defer' and do not read it as 'biopsy'. It means the panel cannot settle
this man and the retrieved documents have to.

## Intervención 5 — EXPERT-EAU

*EAU guideline specialist; speaks only from the guideline text he retrieved* · vuelta 1

GUIDELINE
The guideline discusses using the PI-RADS score to guide the decision to perform a biopsy. It states that a PI-RADS threshold of $\ge 3$ is used to trigger a biopsy. It also notes that a PI-RADS 5 lesion is associated with an 83% detection rate of csPCa in a meta-analysis.

WHAT THE CLASSIFIER'S BID DOES NOT SETTLE
The classifier's suggestion of 'NO BIOPSY' is not sufficiently informed by the guideline because it fails to incorporate the PI-RADS score, which is a key variable in the guideline's risk-adapted matrix. The guideline sets a threshold of PI-RADS $\ge 3$ to trigger a biopsy, which the classifier's limited variable set cannot adequately represent.

WHAT WE STILL NEED
the mpMRI prose - does it compare against an earlier study? if the lesion is unchanged the guideline does not support re-sampling; if new or larger it does
the PSA-D category - does it compare against a specific threshold? the guideline uses PSA-D categories to guide the decision.
the prior biopsy status - does it compare against a specific outcome? the guideline discusses repeat biopsy after a negative biopsy based on risk factors.
the PI-RADS score - does it compare against a specific threshold? the guideline explicitly uses PI-RADS $\ge 3$ to trigger biopsy.

## Intervención 6 — MODERATOR

*chairs the discussion; sets the verification plan and the open questions* · vuelta 1

This case hinges on whether the specific characteristics of the PI-RADS 5 lesion, as detailed in the MRI report, warrant a biopsy despite the prior positive diagnosis.

Before anyone argues, this is what I want established, and by whom.

REGISTRAR — pull these up, and answer exactly the question attached to each:
  radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Determine if the mpMRI prose compares the current lesion against an earlier study.
  psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> Determine the PSA trend to assess if it compares against a specific threshold.

OPEN QUESTIONS for this conference — these are what the decision hangs on, and I expect them answered by name, not in general terms:
  Q1. Does the mpMRI prose indicate whether the PI-RADS 5 lesion is new or larger compared to the earlier study?
  Q2. Does the PSA-D category comparison against a specific threshold, as mentioned in the guideline, need to be established?

## Intervención 7 — REGISTRAR

*the registrar who pulls up documents; reports what they say, nothing else* · vuelta 1

WHAT I FOUND
radiology_report
The mpMRI prose indicates the lesion is a focal lesion identified in the left peripheral zone, and it does not explicitly state whether it is new or larger compared to an earlier study.
psa_trend
The PSA trend shows values from "Dec 2023" with a value of "4.5" to "Feb 2025" with a value of "10.92".

WHAT I DID NOT OPEN
I did not open the previous_notes because the moderator did not explicitly ask for it, and the information retrieved from the other requested documents was sufficient to address the immediate questions.

WHAT THIS SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now
The mpMRI report identifies a PI-RADS 5 lesion, which is associated with an 83% detection rate of csPCa in a meta-analysis.
The PSA trend shows a rising trend from 4.5 ng/mL in Dec 2023 to 10.92 ng/mL in Feb 2025.

AGAINST sampling this patient now
The prior biopsy status is positive, meaning the tissue diagnosis is already established.

WHERE THIS LEANS
The findings suggest that the high PI-RADS score and rising PSA support proceeding with further investigation, despite the prior positive biopsy.
LEAN: biopsy

## Intervención 8 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

SUFFICIENCY
The registrar's retrieval of the MRI report and PSA trend partially answered the moderator's questions, but did not fully resolve the ambiguity regarding the comparison of the lesion size/novelty and the specific PSA-D threshold comparison.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE CLASSIFIER
The retrieved evidence aligns with the leaning towards biopsy, as the high PI-RADS 5 score and rising PSA trend support further investigation, which contrasts with the classifier's 'NO BIOPSY' bid.

THE OPEN QUESTIONS, ONE BY ONE
Q1. Does the mpMRI prose indicate whether the PI-RADS 5 lesion is new or larger compared to the earlier study? Answered by the registrar; the report does not explicitly state whether it is new or larger.
Q2. Does the PSA-D category comparison against a specific threshold, as mentioned in the guideline, need to be established? Not answered; this comparison remains an open question.

WHAT CARRIES WEIGHT, AND WHY
The guideline variables relevant here are the PI-RADS score (as it sets a threshold for biopsy), the PSA trend (as it indicates progression), and the prior biopsy status (as it establishes a baseline). The guideline does not explicitly support the room's leaning on the prior positive biopsy status as a definitive stop sign.

MY SUGGESTION TO THE CHAIR
I suggest proceeding with a biopsy, leaning towards a more aggressive sampling strategy given the PI-RADS 5 finding and the rising PSA trend, despite the prior positive diagnosis.

VERDICT: ready | SUGGEST: biopsy | MISSING: none

[The conference closes after pass 1: the verifier called the record ready. The chair decides on the record as it stands.]

## Intervención 9 — CHAIR

*the senior urologist who signs the decision* · vuelta 1

MY DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

Despite the prior positive biopsy, the high PI-RADS 5 score and the rising PSA trend from 4.5 to 10.92 ng/mL strongly support further investigation. The prior positive diagnosis does not preclude re-sampling when imaging features are highly suspicious and PSA is progressing. The room converged on proceeding with a biopsy to better characterize the lesion and guide definitive management.
