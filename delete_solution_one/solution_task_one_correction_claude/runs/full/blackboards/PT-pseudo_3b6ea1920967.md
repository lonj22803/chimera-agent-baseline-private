## [1] CASE FILE

**INTAKE** — *the patient record, verbatim; adds no interpretation*

The structured clinical record below is the read-only panel the urologist sees up front, exactly as it arrives in this patient's record. The documents it refers to are masked and must be retrieved.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_3b6ea1920967
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 11 Jan 2025.
Referrer: Dr. K. Bakker (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 64-year-old male
  - PSA: 6.5 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 4 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.11 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 1.22 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 4.5 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 59.14 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 3
  - DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.7465537 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Not reported
  - Problem list / PMHx: none recorded
  - Current medication: None
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 6.5 ng/mL. PI-RADS 4. PSAD 0.11. Prostate volume 59 mL. csPCa 0.75.

Vitals: weight 70 kg, height 174 cm, BMI 23.1, BP 146/61 mmHg, HR 63 bpm. Smoking: Ex-smoker (38 pack-yr, quit 2007).

Chief complaint: Clinical assessment required due to a prior prostate cancer diagnosis coupled with a recent PSA increase to 6.5 ng/mL.

History: A 64-year-old retired primary school teacher initially came to medical attention for an incidental PSA rise in early 2023 and has since remained under surveillance after his first positive biopsy. He is widowed and shares his home with a long-term partner, enjoying an active routine that features weekend hiking alongside moderate alcohol intake of roughly four units weekly. He reports moderate lower urinary tract symptoms scoring 13 on the IPSS, while explicitly denying hematuria, bone pain, or unexplained weight loss. His smoking history includes 38 pack-years, having ceased consumption in 2007. He maintains a residence situated over ninety minutes from the clinic and has expressed a preference for telephone follow-ups when clinically suitable, having recently finished a baseline memory clinic screening and a standard audiology assessment.

Physical examination: DRE — texture: smooth and firm; mobility: unrestricted; asymmetry: absent. The gland presents as symmetrically enlarged without palpable nodules. General examination remains unremarkable, with stable vital signs, clear lung fields, and a regular cardiac rhythm. Peripheral lymphadenopathy and abdominal masses are notably absent.

Patient info: retired primary school teacher; Widowed; Lives with partner.
Next of kin: Spouse / partner (primary contact).

Lifestyle: alcohol 4 units / week; exercise Hiking on weekends; IPSS score: 13/35 (moderate LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Audiology — hearing test; Memory clinic — baseline screening.
Admin: Lives >90 min from clinic; phone follow-up preferred where clinically safe.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


[Note for the conference: for a task-1 biopsy decision only FOUR masked documents exist on file - the radiology / mpMRI report, the PSA history, the previous notes and the laboratory panel - plus the family-history anamnesis. There is no pathology report to retrieve for this task; the prior-biopsy status in the panel above is all the pathology information on record.]

## [2] STATISTICAL PRIOR (classifier)

**EXPERT-PRIOR** — *statistical expert; bagged classifier over the structured panel, trained on the labelled cohort, out-of-fold honest*

A basic classifier, whose sole purpose is to provide a suggestion, produces this result along with its associated uncertainty. The purpose of this decision is to use it as an initial reference point for discussing the results.

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY
  p(biopsy = yes) = 0.66 +/- 0.16   (95% CI 0.34-0.97)

Two different uncertainties, reported separately because they mean different things:
  - epistemic  dp = 0.16  — the error bar on this number. It is the spread
    across bootstrap members: how much the answer would move with a different training sample.
  - aleatoric  H  = 0.93 of 1.00 — how mixed the outcome was among
    patients this model cannot tell apart. High H means the disagreement is in the data, not in
    the model, and more labelled cases would not fix it.

TIER 'discuss': p +/- dp straddles 0.5. The classifier genuinely CANNOT tell the two answers apart here. Its number is a starting point only. Measured accuracy in this tier on the labelled cohort: 0.488 over 43 cases.

Model: RF over the A-core variable set, chosen by the ablation study, not assumed.
Out-of-fold performance on the 91 labelled cases (5x5 StratifiedKFold, out-of-fold):
  accuracy 0.714 (majority-class baseline 0.615), AUC 0.789, F1(yes) 0.78.
Variables it could not read for this patient: none.

It has read ONLY the structured panel and the parsed record. It has not reasoned about the
prose of the mpMRI report, and it does not know what this patient's management plan is.

## [3] GUIDELINE CRITERION FOR THIS SITUATION

**EXPERT-PROTOCOL** — *protocol expert; applies the guideline criterion for this patient's clinical situation*

CLINICAL SITUATION: prior positive biopsy.

THIS CRITERION RETURNS NO ANSWER FOR THIS PATIENT.

The criterion: The visible panel does NOT determine this decision. The patient already has a tissue diagnosis, so neither a high PI-RADS nor a rising PSA is new information. The decision must come from the retrieved documents: whether the prior grade is documented, whether the lesion changed against a previous MRI, whether a surveillance re-biopsy is due, and whether treatment is already agreed.

Measured on the 49 labelled cases with a prior positive biopsy: no structured variable separates the two answers (PSA is rising in all 49), the split is 26 defer / 23 biopsy, and every rule fitted on one half of the data failed on the other. This is genuinely undetermined by the panel.

Do not read this as 'defer' and do not read it as 'biopsy'. It means the panel cannot settle the case and the retrieved documents must.

Like the statistical prior, this expert has read ONLY the visible panel. It has not seen the
mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the laboratory panel.

## [4] IMAGE-EMBEDDING PREDICTOR

**EXPERT-IMAGE** — *image-embedding expert; frozen foundation-model MRI vectors behind a trained head*

Frozen foundation-model embeddings on file for this patient: MRI image (1 vector).
The raw vectors are never shown; only a compact score would be.

No calibrated head is deployed for the biopsy decision, so no score was produced. The probe that measured this modality for task 1 reported AUC 0.43 (at or below chance), which is why nothing is being asserted here.

Bottom line for the chair: the image-embedding route contributes NO usable evidence for this
biopsy decision. Decide on the structured panel, the retrieved documents and the guidelines.
Do not cite imaging-embedding support in the reasoning, and do not let the absence of a score
count as a negative finding.

## [5] AGENDA (round 1)

**MODERATOR** — *moderator; owns the agenda and decides whether the conference may close*

AGENDA FOR ROUND 1. These are the documents this case needs opened, and the question each one must answer. Open these and nothing else unless a named question requires it.

  - radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Does the current mpMRI lesion size/zone compare against an earlier study?
  - psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> What is the serial PSA trend beyond the headline value?
  - previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and patient agreement?

This case hinges on the retrieved documents to determine if the prior positive biopsy status, combined with the current PSA rise and PI-RADS 4 finding, warrants a re-biopsy or deferral, as the initial panel is inconclusive. Agenda capped at 3 documents; dropped laboratory_results.

## [6] GAPS AND DOUBTS (round 1)

**LLM-1-GAP-ANALYST** — *raises doubt only; has no access to clinical documents and issues no recommendation*

WHAT THE PRIOR CANNOT SEE
The statistical prior only weighed the structured panel, which includes PSA 6.5 ng/mL, PI-RADS 4, prior positive biopsy, and csPCa probability 0.7465537. It cannot account for the context provided by the retrieved documents, such as the specific PSA velocity (1.22 ng/mL/yr), the patient's history of prior positive biopsy, or the specific findings from the mpMRI prose or previous notes.

WHY THE SUGGESTION COULD BE WRONG
The prior suggested biopsy with a probability of 0.66, which falls into the 'discuss' tier, meaning the model cannot reliably distinguish between biopsy and deferral based on the input. This is likely because the prior is not accounting for the fact that the prior positive biopsy status fundamentally changes the question from "does he have cancer?" to "is the existing lesion progressing?" The high csPCa probability (0.7465537) might be misleading if the prior positive biopsy already established a diagnosis, making the question of *further* biopsy inappropriate.

WHAT TO RETRIEVE, AND WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE ANSWER
1. radiology report - Does the current mpMRI lesion size/zone compare against an earlier study?
2. psa_trend - What is the serial PSA trend beyond the headline value?
3. previous_notes - What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and patient agreement?
4. laboratory panel - What are the specific laboratory results?

GUIDELINE ANCHOR
The guideline search indicates that the decision hinges on whether the prior grade is documented, whether the lesion changed against a previous MRI, and whether a surveillance re-biopsy is due.

## [7] EVIDENCE REPORT (round 1)

**LLM-2-EVIDENCE** — *the only participant who retrieved documents; reports findings, not verdicts*

RETRIEVED
get_mri_report
Radiology Division | Erasmus MC University Medical Center | 08 Jan 2025
The mpMRI report identifies a PI-RADS 4 lesion in the left mid peripheral zone, measuring roughly 11 mm, with early focal enhancement. It notes no evidence of extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion.

get_psa_trend
The serial PSA trend shows values: Jan 2023 (2.1 ng/mL), Sep 2023 (3.1 ng/mL), May 2024 (4.5 ng/mL), and Jan 2025 (6.5 ng/mL). This indicates a clear rising trajectory.

get_previous_notes
The previous notes document a consultation on 13 Sep 2024 where a PSA escalation from 4.5 ng/mL to 5.1 ng/mL was noted, leading to a referral for clinical assessment due to the patient's history of a prior positive biopsy.

NOT RETRIEVED
laboratory_results
The full laboratory panel was not retrieved because the moderator's agenda did not explicitly require it, and no immediate question arose from the retrieved documents that would necessitate its opening.

WHAT THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now:
- PSA trend shows a clear rising trajectory (4.5 ng/mL in May 2024 to 6.5 ng/mL in Jan 2025).
- The previous notes confirm a history of a prior positive biopsy and a documented PSA escalation leading to referral.
- The mpMRI shows a PI-RADS 4 lesion, which is a high-risk finding.

AGAINST sampling this patient now:
- The mpMRI report does not explicitly state if the current lesion size/zone compares against an earlier study, only describing the current state.

WHERE THIS LEANS
The evidence strongly supports the need for further investigation due to the rising PSA trend and the history of a prior positive biopsy, aligning with the guideline criterion that requires assessing progression.
LEAN: biopsy

[Opened in this round: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes. Open on the board so far: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes.]

## [8] CLOSING CHECK (round 1)

**MODERATOR** — *moderator; owns the agenda and decides whether the conference may close*

THE CONFERENCE MAY CLOSE.

Positions on the table: prior=yes, protocol=abstains, evidence=yes.
Consensus: yes — unanimous among those who took a position.
Agenda: requested ['radiology_report', 'psa_trend', 'previous_notes']; opened ['radiology_report', 'psa_trend', 'previous_notes']; still missing nothing.

The retrieved documents (PSA trend showing clear rise, previous notes confirming prior biopsy and escalation, and MRI showing a PI-RADS 4 lesion) strongly support the need for further investigation, leading to a lean towards biopsy.

The chair decides on the record as it stands.

## [9] FINAL DECISION AND FORM

**LLM-3-CHAIR** — *chairs the conference; the only participant who decides*

FINAL DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

The decision leans toward biopsy because the retrieved evidence showed a clear rising PSA trajectory from 4.5 ng/mL to 6.5 ng/mL and previous notes confirmed a history of a prior positive biopsy. Although the guideline criterion abstained, the evidence strongly supports further investigation due to the progression, which is a factor that would change management. The statistical prior suggested biopsy, and the retrieved documents confirmed the clinical suspicion.
