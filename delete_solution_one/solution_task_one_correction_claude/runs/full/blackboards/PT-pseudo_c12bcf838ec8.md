## [1] CASE FILE

**INTAKE** — *the patient record, verbatim; adds no interpretation*

The structured clinical record below is the read-only panel the urologist sees up front, exactly as it arrives in this patient's record. The documents it refers to are masked and must be retrieved.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_c12bcf838ec8
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 28 Feb 2025.
Referrer: Dr. T. Hendriks (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior negative biopsy.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 63-year-old male
  - PSA: 3.4 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 3 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.05 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: -0.28 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 3.5 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 58.0 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 2
  - DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Negative (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.71182245 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Obesity (BMI >30), Osteoarthritis
  - Problem list / PMHx: Obesity (BMI >30), Osteoarthritis
  - Current medication: paracetamol PRN
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 3.4 ng/mL. PI-RADS 3. PSAD 0.05. Prostate volume 58 mL. csPCa 0.71.

Vitals: weight 75 kg, height 183 cm, BMI 22.4, BP 111/68 mmHg, HR 68 bpm. Smoking: Ex-smoker (23 pack-yr, quit 2011).

Chief complaint: A request for clinical reassessment has been submitted after the initial biopsy returned negative and recent MRI results are now available.

History: First assessed in May 2022 due to a PSA elevation, this 63-year-old gentleman has since completed a negative biopsy and entered serial monitoring. He works as a retired bank clerk, is divorced, and resides alone with his adult son living nearby as his main contact. A history of smoking covers 23 pack-years, though he quit in 2011. He stays active with twice-weekly tennis matches and drinks no alcohol. Lower urinary tract symptoms remain minimal, scoring 4 out of 35 on the IPSS. Recent administrative records note he lives more than 90 minutes from the clinic, favoring telephone follow-up when clinically suitable. Earlier this month, he underwent a routine audiology check for mild hearing changes and has a gastroenterology surveillance colonoscopy scheduled; neither impacts his urological pathway. His medical background includes osteoarthritis and obesity (BMI >30), currently managed with paracetamol on an as-needed basis. He explicitly denies bone pain, haematuria, or unexplained weight loss.

Physical examination: Normal DRE: texture smooth and firm, no palpable nodules or asymmetry. The gland is symmetrically enlarged. General assessment shows stable vital signs, registering a blood pressure of 111/68 mmHg and a heart rate of 68 bpm. Peripheral lymphadenopathy and abdominal masses are absent.

Patient info: retired bank clerk; Divorced; Lives alone; adult son nearby.
Next of kin: Adult son (primary contact).

Lifestyle: alcohol 0 units / week (alcohol-free); exercise Tennis 2x/week; IPSS score: 4/35 (mild LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Audiology — hearing test; Gastroenterology — surveillance colonoscopy.
Admin: Lives >90 min from clinic; phone follow-up preferred where clinically safe.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


[Note for the conference: for a task-1 biopsy decision only FOUR masked documents exist on file - the radiology / mpMRI report, the PSA history, the previous notes and the laboratory panel - plus the family-history anamnesis. There is no pathology report to retrieve for this task; the prior-biopsy status in the panel above is all the pathology information on record.]

## [2] STATISTICAL PRIOR (classifier)

**EXPERT-PRIOR** — *statistical expert; bagged classifier over the structured panel, trained on the labelled cohort, out-of-fold honest*

A basic classifier, whose sole purpose is to provide a suggestion, produces this result along with its associated uncertainty. The purpose of this decision is to use it as an initial reference point for discussing the results.

SUGGESTION: NO BIOPSY
  p(biopsy = yes) = 0.31 +/- 0.12   (95% CI 0.08-0.54)

Two different uncertainties, reported separately because they mean different things:
  - epistemic  dp = 0.12  — the error bar on this number. It is the spread
    across bootstrap members: how much the answer would move with a different training sample.
  - aleatoric  H  = 0.89 of 1.00 — how mixed the outcome was among
    patients this model cannot tell apart. High H means the disagreement is in the data, not in
    the model, and more labelled cases would not fix it.

TIER 'supports': p +/- dp does not cross 0.5 but p +/- 1.96*dp does. A direction, not a conclusion; a weighted vote. Measured accuracy in this tier on the labelled cohort: 0.8 over 20 cases.

Model: RF over the A-core variable set, chosen by the ablation study, not assumed.
Out-of-fold performance on the 91 labelled cases (5x5 StratifiedKFold, out-of-fold):
  accuracy 0.714 (majority-class baseline 0.615), AUC 0.789, F1(yes) 0.78.
Variables it could not read for this patient: none.

It has read ONLY the structured panel and the parsed record. It has not reasoned about the
prose of the mpMRI report, and it does not know what this patient's management plan is.

## [3] GUIDELINE CRITERION FOR THIS SITUATION

**EXPERT-PROTOCOL** — *protocol expert; applies the guideline criterion for this patient's clinical situation*

CLINICAL SITUATION: prior negative biopsy.

CRITERION VERDICT: DEFER BIOPSY.

The criterion: Re-biopsy (targeted) when the mpMRI shows a PI-RADS 4-5 lesion; do not repeat a negative biopsy for a PI-RADS 3 or lower picture that has not changed.

In the labelled cohort this criterion matched the reading urologist in 16 of the 18 cases with a prior negative biopsy.

Track record of this criterion on the labelled cohort: 16 of 18 cases matched the reading urologist. Departing from it needs a specific finding from a retrieved document, named explicitly - not a restatement of the panel numbers it already used.

Like the statistical prior, this expert has read ONLY the visible panel. It has not seen the
mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the laboratory panel.

## [4] IMAGE-EMBEDDING PREDICTOR

**EXPERT-IMAGE** — *image-embedding expert; frozen foundation-model MRI vectors behind a trained head*

Frozen foundation-model embeddings on file for this patient: MRI image (1 vector).
The raw vectors are never shown; only a compact score would be.

No calibrated head is deployed for the biopsy decision, so no score was produced. The probe that measured this modality for task 1 reported AUC 0.43 (at or below chance), which is why nothing is being asserted here.

Bottom line for the chair: the image-embedding route contributes NO usable evidence for this
biopsy decision. Decide on the structured panel, the retrieved documents and the guidelines.
Do not cite imaging-embedding support in the reasoning, and do not let the absence of a score
count as a negative finding.

## [5] AGENDA (round 1)

**MODERATOR** — *moderator; owns the agenda and decides whether the conference may close*

AGENDA FOR ROUND 1. These are the documents this case needs opened, and the question each one must answer. Open these and nothing else unless a named question requires it.

  - radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Does the mpMRI show a PI-RADS 4-5 lesion that warrants re-biopsy?
  - psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> Is there a significant change or trend in the PSA values since the prior assessment?
  - previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> What was the prior management context, including prior grade and surveillance pathway?

This case hinges on the mpMRI findings and the history of prior negative biopsy. We must retrieve the imaging report, PSA trend, and prior notes to determine if the clinical situation has changed enough to warrant deviating from the deferral guideline.

## [6] GAPS AND DOUBTS (round 1)

**LLM-1-GAP-ANALYST** — *raises doubt only; has no access to clinical documents and issues no recommendation*

WHAT THE PRIOR CANNOT SEE
The statistical prior only weighed structured panel data (PSA 3.4, PI-RADS 3, csPCa probability 0.71182245, DRE Normal, Prostate Volume 58.0 mL) and did not incorporate the context of the mpMRI prose, the PSA velocity (-0.28 ng/mL/yr), or the specific management context of the prior negative biopsy.
The prior cannot weigh the clinical significance of the PI-RADS 3 score in conjunction with the prior negative biopsy status, nor can it weigh the potential impact of the PSA trend on the decision.

WHY THE SUGGESTION COULD BE WRONG
The prior suggested NO BIOPSY with a probability of 0.31 +/- 0.12. The wide epistemic error bar (dp = 0.12) suggests high uncertainty in the model's prediction for this specific patient. This uncertainty could be due to the model not accounting for the interaction between a PI-RADS 3 finding and a prior negative biopsy, or the high aleatoric uncertainty (H=0.89) indicating the outcome is highly mixed in the training data. The prior might be wrong because it failed to recognize that the guideline criterion explicitly requires retrieving specific information to override the default suggestion.

WHAT TO RETRIEVE, AND WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE ANSWER
radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> To determine if the mpMRI shows a PI-RADS 4-5 lesion that warrants re-biopsy, as per the moderator's agenda.
psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> To assess if there is a significant change or trend in the PSA values since the prior assessment, which is crucial for risk stratification.
previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> To understand the prior management context, including prior grade and surveillance pathway, which is necessary to assess if the clinical situation has changed enough to warrant deviating from the deferral guideline.
laboratory_panel (get_laboratory_panel) -> To check the full lab panel, as the guideline mentions PSA density as a predictor.
GUIDELINE ANCHOR
The guideline states: "Re-biopsy (targeted) when the mpMRI shows a PI-RADS 4-5 lesion; do not repeat a negative biopsy for a PI-RADS 3 or lower picture that has not changed." This constrains the decision by setting a clear threshold based on the current imaging findings.

## [7] EVIDENCE REPORT (round 1)

**LLM-2-EVIDENCE** — *the only participant who retrieved documents; reports findings, not verdicts*

RETRIEVED
get_mri_report
MRI report: PI-RADS 3 lesion in the right peripheral zone. Lesion size is roughly 12 mm. No evidence of extraprostatic extension or suspicious lymphadenopathy.
get_psa_trend
PSA trend: PSA values have increased from 2.3 ng/mL (May 2022) to 3.4 ng/mL (Feb 2025). This indicates a rising trend.
get_previous_notes
Previous notes: Documented on 07 Sep 2023, Dr. T. Hendriks recorded a PSA level of 3.1 ng/mL, and a referral to urology was initiated for further evaluation and imaging consideration. No prior biopsy grade was documented.

NOT RETRIEVED
get_lab_results
The full laboratory panel was not retrieved because the moderator's agenda did not explicitly require it, and no new laboratory questions arose from the retrieved documents.

WHAT THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now:
- PSA trend: Rising trend from 2.3 ng/mL to 3.4 ng/mL.
- Guideline criterion: The guideline states to re-biopsy for PI-RADS 4-5 lesions. (Note: The current finding is PI-RADS 3).

AGAINST sampling this patient now:
- MRI report: PI-RADS 3 lesion in the right peripheral zone.
- Guideline criterion: Do not repeat a negative biopsy for a PI-RADS 3 or lower picture that has not changed.

WHERE THIS LEANS
The evidence points towards deferral based strictly on the guideline criterion, as the MRI shows a PI-RADS 3 lesion and no change is explicitly noted in the report, aligning with the protocol.
LEAN: defer

[Opened in this round: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes. Open on the board so far: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes.]

## [8] CLOSING CHECK (round 1)

**MODERATOR** — *moderator; owns the agenda and decides whether the conference may close*

THE CONFERENCE MAY CLOSE.

Positions on the table: prior=no, protocol=no, evidence=no.
Consensus: yes — unanimous among those who took a position.
Agenda: requested ['radiology_report', 'psa_trend', 'previous_notes']; opened ['radiology_report', 'psa_trend', 'previous_notes']; still missing nothing.

The retrieved evidence confirms the PI-RADS 3 finding and the rising PSA trend, leading to a conclusion of deferral based on the EXPERT-PROTOCOL criterion.

The chair decides on the record as it stands.

## [9] FINAL DECISION AND FORM

**LLM-3-CHAIR** — *chairs the conference; the only participant who decides*

FINAL DECISION: NO BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

The decision is to defer biopsy because the EXPERT-PROTOCOL criterion dictates against repeating a negative biopsy for a PI-RADS 3 lesion that has not changed. The retrieved evidence confirmed the current finding is PI-RADS 3, and the PSA trend was rising from 2.3 ng/mL to 3.4 ng/mL. The statistical prior suggested no biopsy, and the retrieved evidence converged with the guideline criterion, leading to a clear deferral.
