## [1] CASE FILE

**INTAKE** — *the patient record, verbatim; adds no interpretation*

The structured clinical record below is the read-only panel the urologist sees up front, exactly as it arrives in this patient's record. The documents it refers to are masked and must be retrieved.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_47c373e230b6
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 09 Feb 2025.
Referrer: Dr. P. van Dijk (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 75-year-old male
  - PSA: 10.0 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 5 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.27 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 1.78 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 8.3 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 41.0 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 1
  - DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.7478973 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Hypertension, Hypercholesterolaemia, Benign prostatic hyperplasia
  - Problem list / PMHx: Hypertension, Hypercholesterolaemia, Benign prostatic hyperplasia
  - Current medication: amlodipine, valsartan, lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, simvastatin, tamsulosin
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 10 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 0.27. Prostate volume 41 mL. csPCa 0.75.

Vitals: weight 66 kg, height 180 cm, BMI 20.4, BP 122/66 mmHg, HR 73 bpm. Smoking: Ex-smoker (18 pack-yr, quit 2006).

Chief complaint: Ascending prostate-specific antigen readings and a history of a previously positive biopsy prompt this clinical assessment.

History: A 75-year-old male, formerly employed as a warehouse manager, first entered the diagnostic pathway in late 2022 due to an elevated prostate-specific antigen level. His medical background includes hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, alongside benign prostatic hyperplasia. Current pharmacotherapy comprises amlodipine, valsartan, lisinopril, metoprolol, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and tamsulosin to address bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. Tobacco use ceased in 2006 after an 18 pack-year accumulation. He continues a weekly swimming regimen. Although widowed, he resides with his partner who offers daily assistance, while his adult children stop by each week to manage paperwork. Recent visits to ophthalmology for cataract surveillance and a standard chest radiograph returned normal results. He denies experiencing fresh urinary blockage, blood in the urine, or skeletal discomfort, maintaining a stable International Prostate Symptom Score of 12.

Physical examination: Normal DRE: The gland demonstrates a smooth, firm consistency with symmetric enlargement and no palpable irregularities. Vital parameters remain stable: blood pressure registers at 122/66 mmHg with a regular cardiac rhythm of 73 bpm. General survey shows a well-nourished individual free of acute distress. Lung fields are clear, and abdominal palpation reveals a soft, non-tender contour.

Patient info: warehouse manager; Widowed; Lives with partner; adult children visit weekly.
Next of kin: Spouse / partner (primary contact).

Lifestyle: alcohol 12 units / week; exercise Swimming 1x/week; IPSS score: 12/35 (moderate LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Ophthalmology — cataract review; Radiology — chest X-ray (routine).
Admin: Daughter manages communication; CC on letters with patient consent.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


[Note for the conference: for a task-1 biopsy decision only FOUR masked documents exist on file - the radiology / mpMRI report, the PSA history, the previous notes and the laboratory panel - plus the family-history anamnesis. There is no pathology report to retrieve for this task; the prior-biopsy status in the panel above is all the pathology information on record.]

## [2] STATISTICAL PRIOR (classifier)

**EXPERT-PRIOR** — *statistical expert; bagged classifier over the structured panel, trained on the labelled cohort, out-of-fold honest*

A basic classifier, whose sole purpose is to provide a suggestion, produces this result along with its associated uncertainty. The purpose of this decision is to use it as an initial reference point for discussing the results.

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY
  p(biopsy = yes) = 0.68 +/- 0.16   (95% CI 0.36-0.99)

Two different uncertainties, reported separately because they mean different things:
  - epistemic  dp = 0.16  — the error bar on this number. It is the spread
    across bootstrap members: how much the answer would move with a different training sample.
  - aleatoric  H  = 0.91 of 1.00 — how mixed the outcome was among
    patients this model cannot tell apart. High H means the disagreement is in the data, not in
    the model, and more labelled cases would not fix it.

TIER 'supports': p +/- dp does not cross 0.5 but p +/- 1.96*dp does. A direction, not a conclusion; a weighted vote. Measured accuracy in this tier on the labelled cohort: 0.8 over 20 cases.

Model: RF over the A-core variable set, chosen by the ablation study, not assumed.
Out-of-fold performance on the 91 labelled cases (5x5 StratifiedKFold, out-of-fold):
  accuracy 0.714 (majority-class baseline 0.615), AUC 0.789, F1(yes) 0.78.
Variables it could not read for this patient: none.

It has read ONLY the structured panel and the parsed record. It has not reasoned about the
prose of the mpMRI report, and it does not know what this patient's management plan is.

## [3] GUIDELINE CRITERION FOR THIS SITUATION

**EXPERT-PROTOCOL** — *protocol expert; applies the guideline criterion for this patient's clinical situation*

CLINICAL SITUATION: prior positive biopsy.

THIS CRITERION RETURNS NO ANSWER FOR THIS PATIENT.

The criterion: The visible panel does NOT determine this decision. The patient already has a tissue diagnosis, so neither a high PI-RADS nor a rising PSA is new information. The decision must come from the retrieved documents: whether the prior grade is documented, whether the lesion changed against a previous MRI, whether a surveillance re-biopsy is due, and whether treatment is already agreed.

Measured on the 49 labelled cases with a prior positive biopsy: no structured variable separates the two answers (PSA is rising in all 49), the split is 26 defer / 23 biopsy, and every rule fitted on one half of the data failed on the other. This is genuinely undetermined by the panel.

Do not read this as 'defer' and do not read it as 'biopsy'. It means the panel cannot settle the case and the retrieved documents must.

Like the statistical prior, this expert has read ONLY the visible panel. It has not seen the
mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the laboratory panel.

## [4] IMAGE-EMBEDDING PREDICTOR

**EXPERT-IMAGE** — *image-embedding expert; frozen foundation-model MRI vectors behind a trained head*

Frozen foundation-model embeddings on file for this patient: MRI image (1 vector).
The raw vectors are never shown; only a compact score would be.

No calibrated head is deployed for the biopsy decision, so no score was produced. The probe that measured this modality for task 1 reported AUC 0.43 (at or below chance), which is why nothing is being asserted here.

Bottom line for the chair: the image-embedding route contributes NO usable evidence for this
biopsy decision. Decide on the structured panel, the retrieved documents and the guidelines.
Do not cite imaging-embedding support in the reasoning, and do not let the absence of a score
count as a negative finding.

## [5] AGENDA (round 1)

**MODERATOR** — *moderator; owns the agenda and decides whether the conference may close*

AGENDA FOR ROUND 1. These are the documents this case needs opened, and the question each one must answer. Open these and nothing else unless a named question requires it.

  - radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Does the current mpMRI lesion size/zone compare against an earlier study?
  - psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> What is the serial PSA trend beyond the headline value?
  - previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and management agreement?

This case hinges on the retrieved documents to determine if the prior positive biopsy status, combined with current imaging and PSA trajectory, warrants a re-biopsy or deferral, as the initial panel is inconclusive. Agenda capped at 3 documents; dropped laboratory_results.

## [6] GAPS AND DOUBTS (round 1)

**LLM-1-GAP-ANALYST** — *raises doubt only; has no access to clinical documents and issues no recommendation*

WHAT THE PRIOR CANNOT SEE
The statistical prior only weighed the structured panel, failing to incorporate the specific clinical context of the PI-RADS 5 score, the rising PSA velocity (1.78 ng/mL/yr), and the history of a prior positive biopsy. It did not reason about the implications of the prior positive result in the context of the current high-risk imaging.

WHY THE SUGGESTION COULD BE WRONG
The prior suggested biopsy (p=0.68) despite the guideline stating the panel is inconclusive. This could be wrong because the model failed to account for the guideline criterion that the decision *must* rely on retrieved documents, which it did not. Furthermore, the high aleatoric uncertainty (H=0.91) suggests the model is highly uncertain about the outcome in this specific patient profile, meaning its suggestion is based on weak evidence.

WHAT TO RETRIEVE, AND WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE ANSWER
radiology report - Does the current mpMRI lesion size/zone compare against an earlier study?
psa_trend - What is the serial PSA trend beyond the headline value?
previous_notes - What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and management agreement?
previous_notes - What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and management agreement?

GUIDELINE ANCHOR
The guideline states that the decision must come from retrieved documents, specifically assessing if the prior grade is documented, if the lesion changed against a previous MRI, and if surveillance is due.

## [7] EVIDENCE REPORT (round 1)

**LLM-2-EVIDENCE** — *the only participant who retrieved documents; reports findings, not verdicts*

RETRIEVED
get_mri_report
MRI report: A discrete 14 mm focus occupies the left mid-gland peripheral zone, PI-RADS 5 designation. The report does not explicitly compare this finding to a previous MRI, only noting the current state.

get_psa_trend
PSA trend: [{"date": "Nov 2022", "val": 9.1}, {"date": "Aug 2023", "val": 2.8}, {"date": "May 2024", "val": 6.3}, {"date": "Feb 2025", "val": 10.0}]. The trend shows a significant rise from 2.8 ng/mL in Aug 2023 to 10.0 ng/mL in Feb 2025.

get_previous_notes
Previous notes: The prior biopsy indicated low-grade disease. The patient was directed to urology for detailed assessment, and the latest lab results showed a continuing upward trajectory.

NOT RETRIEVED
laboratory_results
Laboratory results were not retrieved because the moderator's agenda did not explicitly require them, and the retrieved documents provided sufficient context regarding PSA trajectory and prior management.

WHAT THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now:
- MRI report: PI-RADS 5 designation for a 14 mm focus in the peripheral zone.
- PSA trend: Significant rising trend from 2.8 ng/mL (Aug 2023) to 10.0 ng/mL (Feb 2025).
- Previous notes: Prior biopsy showed low-grade disease, and the patient was on routine tracking.

AGAINST sampling this patient now:
- Previous notes: Prior biopsy showed low-grade disease (implying low-risk prior diagnosis).

WHERE THIS LEANS
The combination of a high-risk MRI finding (PI-RADS 5) and a significant, recent rise in PSA strongly supports the need for further investigation, contradicting the guideline's initial ambiguity.
LEAN: biopsy

[Opened in this round: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes. Open on the board so far: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes.]

## [8] CLOSING CHECK (round 1)

**MODERATOR** — *moderator; owns the agenda and decides whether the conference may close*

THE CONFERENCE MAY CLOSE.

Positions on the table: prior=yes, protocol=abstains, evidence=yes.
Consensus: yes — unanimous among those who took a position.
Agenda: requested ['radiology_report', 'psa_trend', 'previous_notes']; opened ['radiology_report', 'psa_trend', 'previous_notes']; still missing nothing.

The retrieved evidence (high PI-RADS 5 MRI, significant rising PSA trend, and prior low-grade biopsy) strongly supports the need for further investigation, leading to a lean towards biopsy.

The chair decides on the record as it stands.

## [9] FINAL DECISION AND FORM

**LLM-3-CHAIR** — *chairs the conference; the only participant who decides*

FINAL DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

The decision leans toward biopsy because the statistical prior suggested it, and the retrieved evidence showed a high-risk PI-RADS 5 lesion combined with a significant rising PSA trend from 2.8 ng/mL to 10.0 ng/mL. Since the prior biopsy indicated low-grade disease, and no retrieved document documented a change in the lesion or an agreed treatment pathway, the combination of high imaging suspicion and rising PSA necessitates further tissue sampling to guide definitive management.
