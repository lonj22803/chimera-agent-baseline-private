## [1] CASE FILE

**INTAKE** — *the patient record, verbatim; adds no interpretation*

The structured clinical record below is the read-only panel the urologist sees up front, exactly as it arrives in this patient's record. The documents it refers to are masked and must be retrieved.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_dd011d696387
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 11 Jan 2025.
Referrer: Dr. M. Jansen (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 75-year-old male
  - PSA: 10.0 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 5 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.372 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 0.55 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 14.0 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 26.91 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 3
  - DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.8577571 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Coronary artery disease, Benign prostatic hyperplasia
  - Problem list / PMHx: Coronary artery disease, Benign prostatic hyperplasia
  - Current medication: atorvastatin, tamsulosin
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 10 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 0.37. Prostate volume 27 mL. csPCa 0.86.

Vitals: weight 92 kg, height 179 cm, BMI 28.7, BP 101/75 mmHg, HR 73 bpm. Smoking: Ex-smoker (13 pack-yr, quit 2002).

Chief complaint: Clinical attention sought for reassessment of a previously confirmed prostate malignancy alongside recent fluctuations in prostate-specific antigen levels.

History: Clinical review initiated to reassess a previously established prostate cancer diagnosis. At 75 years of age, he works as an active dairy farmer and resides independently as a widower, relying on his adult daughter as his main point of contact. Body mass indexes 28.7 at a weight of 92 kg. Tobacco use ceased in 2002, accounting for a cumulative 13 pack-year exposure. Chronic coronary artery disease remains controlled via atorvastatin, while tamsulosin addresses benign prostatic hyperplasia; lower urinary tract symptoms are negligible, scoring just 2 on the IPSS scale. Daily life centers around agricultural work, with otherwise limited physical activity. Alcohol intake stays around three units weekly. Public transit limitations dictate a preference for morning visits. A decades-old meniscal injury occasionally flares during wet conditions, and he maintains routine cardiology appointments solely for blood pressure tracking. Unexplained weight reduction, skeletal discomfort, and blood in the urine are firmly denied, as he prioritizes continuing his agricultural schedule. December 2024 bloodwork revealed a prostate-specific antigen level of 10.0 ng/mL (free fraction 16%), complemented by unremarkable renal panels and complete blood counts. No medication sensitivities exist.

Physical examination: Digital rectal examination proves normal; the prostate presents as symmetrically enlarged with a smooth, firm consistency and absent nodules or asymmetry. Hemodynamic parameters show a blood pressure of 101/75 mmHg and a pulse of 73 beats per minute. Systemic assessment identifies a well-nourished individual exhibiting no signs of acute distress; pulmonary fields are clear and cardiac rhythm remains regular.

Patient info: active dairy farmer; Widowed; Lives alone; adult daughter is primary contact.
Next of kin: None recorded — patient declines to nominate.

Lifestyle: alcohol 3 units / week; exercise Sedentary lifestyle, occasional walking; IPSS score: 2/35 (mild LUTS).


Admin: Patient prefers morning appointments (public transport).

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


[Note for the conference: for a task-1 biopsy decision only FOUR masked documents exist on file - the radiology / mpMRI report, the PSA history, the previous notes and the laboratory panel - plus the family-history anamnesis. There is no pathology report to retrieve for this task; the prior-biopsy status in the panel above is all the pathology information on record.]

## [2] STATISTICAL PRIOR (classifier)

**EXPERT-PRIOR** — *statistical expert; bagged classifier over the structured panel, trained on the labelled cohort, out-of-fold honest*

A basic classifier, whose sole purpose is to provide a suggestion, produces this result along with its associated uncertainty. The purpose of this decision is to use it as an initial reference point for discussing the results.

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY
  p(biopsy = yes) = 0.61 +/- 0.12   (95% CI 0.37-0.85)

Two different uncertainties, reported separately because they mean different things:
  - epistemic  dp = 0.12  — the error bar on this number. It is the spread
    across bootstrap members: how much the answer would move with a different training sample.
  - aleatoric  H  = 0.96 of 1.00 — how mixed the outcome was among
    patients this model cannot tell apart. High H means the disagreement is in the data, not in
    the model, and more labelled cases would not fix it.

TIER 'discuss': p +/- dp straddles 0.5. The classifier genuinely CANNOT tell the two answers apart here. Its number is a starting point only. Measured accuracy in this tier on the labelled cohort: 0.488 over 43 cases.

Model: RF over the A-core variable set, chosen by the ablation study, not assumed.
Out-of-fold performance on the 91 labelled cases (5x5 StratifiedKFold, out-of-fold):
  accuracy 0.714 (majority-class baseline 0.615), AUC 0.789, F1(yes) 0.78.
Variables it could not read for this patient: none.

It has read ONLY the structured panel and the parsed record. It has not reasoned about the
prose of the mpMRI report, and it does not know what this patient's management plan is.

## [3] GUIDELINE CRITERION FOR THIS SITUATION

**EXPERT-PROTOCOL** — *protocol expert; applies the guideline criterion for this patient's clinical situation*

CLINICAL SITUATION: prior positive biopsy.

THIS CRITERION RETURNS NO ANSWER FOR THIS PATIENT.

The criterion: The visible panel does NOT determine this decision. The patient already has a tissue diagnosis, so neither a high PI-RADS nor a rising PSA is new information. The decision must come from the retrieved documents: whether the prior grade is documented, whether the lesion changed against a previous MRI, whether a surveillance re-biopsy is due, and whether treatment is already agreed.

Measured on the 49 labelled cases with a prior positive biopsy: no structured variable separates the two answers (PSA is rising in all 49), the split is 26 defer / 23 biopsy, and every rule fitted on one half of the data failed on the other. This is genuinely undetermined by the panel.

Do not read this as 'defer' and do not read it as 'biopsy'. It means the panel cannot settle the case and the retrieved documents must.

Like the statistical prior, this expert has read ONLY the visible panel. It has not seen the
mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the laboratory panel.

## [4] IMAGE-EMBEDDING PREDICTOR

**EXPERT-IMAGE** — *image-embedding expert; frozen foundation-model MRI vectors behind a trained head*

Frozen foundation-model embeddings on file for this patient: MRI image (1 vector).
The raw vectors are never shown; only a compact score would be.

No calibrated head is deployed for the biopsy decision, so no score was produced. The probe that measured this modality for task 1 reported AUC 0.43 (at or below chance), which is why nothing is being asserted here.

Bottom line for the chair: the image-embedding route contributes NO usable evidence for this
biopsy decision. Decide on the structured panel, the retrieved documents and the guidelines.
Do not cite imaging-embedding support in the reasoning, and do not let the absence of a score
count as a negative finding.

## [5] AGENDA (round 1)

**MODERATOR** — *moderator; owns the agenda and decides whether the conference may close*

AGENDA FOR ROUND 1. These are the documents this case needs opened, and the question each one must answer. Open these and nothing else unless a named question requires it.

  - radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Does the current mpMRI lesion size/zone compare against an earlier study?
  - psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> What is the serial PSA trend beyond the headline value?
  - previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and patient agreement?

This case hinges on the retrieved documents to determine if the prior positive biopsy status, combined with current imaging and PSA trajectory, warrants a re-biopsy or deferral, as the visible panel is insufficient. Agenda capped at 3 documents; dropped laboratory_results.

## [6] GAPS AND DOUBTS (round 1)

**LLM-1-GAP-ANALYST** — *raises doubt only; has no access to clinical documents and issues no recommendation*

WHAT THE PRIOR CANNOT SEE
The statistical model only weighed the structured panel data (PSA 10.0, PI-RADS 5, csPCa probability 0.8577571, etc.). It could not account for the context that the prior biopsy was positive, which fundamentally changes the question from "does he have cancer?" to "is the existing cancer progressing or is this a false positive/recurrent event?" It also ignored the specific clinical context of the rising PSA velocity (0.55 ng/mL/yr) and the specific guideline criteria regarding the need to compare the current MRI to the prior one.

WHY THE SUGGESTION COULD BE WRONG
The prior probability of 0.61 +/- 0.12 suggests the model is in a 'discuss' tier, meaning it cannot reliably distinguish between biopsy and no biopsy. This is likely because the panel is insufficient, as noted by EXPERT-PROTOCOL. Specifically, the model cannot reconcile the high csPCa probability (0.86) with the normal Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) and the prior positive biopsy status, which are internal contradictions that the model failed to weigh correctly. The high aleatoric uncertainty (H=0.96) indicates the disagreement lies in the data itself, suggesting the model is guessing because the input features are ambiguous for this specific clinical scenario.

WHAT TO RETRIEVE, AND WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE ANSWER
radiology report - Does the current mpMRI lesion size/zone compare against an earlier study?
psa_trend - What is the serial PSA trend beyond the headline value?
previous_notes - What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and patient agreement?
previous_notes - What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and patient agreement?

GUIDELINE ANCHOR
The guideline criterion states that the decision must come from retrieved documents: whether the prior grade is documented, whether the lesion changed against a previous MRI, whether a surveillance re-biopsy is due, and whether treatment is already agreed.

## [7] EVIDENCE REPORT (round 1)

**LLM-2-EVIDENCE** — *the only participant who retrieved documents; reports findings, not verdicts*

RETRIEVED
get_mri_report
UMCG Radiology | 08 Jan 2025 | Multiparametric MRI Prostate
The report describes a PI-RADS 5 lesion in the left peripheral zone measuring approximately 14 mm, showing pronounced diffusion restriction and early localized contrast uptake. It does not explicitly compare this to a previous MRI, but notes the current PSA is 10.0 ng/mL with a velocity of 0.55 ng/mL/yr.

get_psa_trend
The serial PSA trend shows a rising trajectory: 2.9 (Nov 2023) -> 1.2 (Mar 2024) -> 4.6 (Jun 2024) -> 8.7 (Sep 2024) -> 10.0 (Jan 2025).

get_previous_notes
The notes indicate a prior positive biopsy was addressed in July 2023, and a follow-up was scheduled for six months later. The notes do not explicitly state the grade of the prior cancer or the current surveillance pathway status.

NOT RETRIEVED
The specific ISUP grade group or Gleason score of the prior biopsy result was not found, which is critical for assessing treatment implications.

WHAT THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS
Findings that argue FOR sampling this patient now:
- Rising PSA trend: 2.9 (Nov 2023) to 10.0 (Jan 2025), with a velocity of 0.55 ng/mL/yr.
- New/Active lesion on MRI: PI-RADS 5 lesion measuring 14 mm in the left peripheral zone.

Findings that argue AGAINST sampling this patient now:
- Prior positive biopsy status: Indicates a known malignancy.
- DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done).

WHERE THIS LEANS
The evidence strongly suggests progression or recurrence given the rising PSA and the presence of a high-risk MRI finding (PI-RADS 5). This leans toward a need for further tissue characterization.
LEAN: biopsy

[Opened in this round: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes. Open on the board so far: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes.]

## [8] CLOSING CHECK (round 1)

**MODERATOR** — *moderator; owns the agenda and decides whether the conference may close*

THE CONFERENCE MAY CLOSE.

Positions on the table: prior=yes, protocol=abstains, evidence=yes.
Consensus: yes — unanimous among those who took a position.
Agenda: requested ['radiology_report', 'psa_trend', 'previous_notes']; opened ['radiology_report', 'psa_trend', 'previous_notes']; still missing nothing.

The retrieved evidence strongly suggests progression or recurrence due to rising PSA and a new high-risk MRI finding, leaning towards a biopsy. The decision is not final as the specific grade of the prior cancer remains unknown.

The chair decides on the record as it stands.

## [9] FINAL DECISION AND FORM

**LLM-3-CHAIR** — *chairs the conference; the only participant who decides*

FINAL DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

The decision to proceed with biopsy is driven by the rising PSA trend (from 2.9 to 10.0 ng/mL over 1 year) and the presence of a high-risk PI-RADS 5 lesion measuring 14 mm. Although the prior positive biopsy status exists, the lack of a documented prior grade means the current findings necessitate further tissue characterization to guide definitive management. The statistical prior suggested biopsy, and the retrieved evidence strongly supports this indication for re-sampling.

Variables that carried weight: bx=important, age=important, psa=important, vol=noted, psad=noted, pirads=important, comorbidity=noted
