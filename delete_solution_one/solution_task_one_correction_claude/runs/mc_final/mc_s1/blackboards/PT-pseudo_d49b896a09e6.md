## [1] CASE FILE

**INTAKE** — *the patient record, verbatim; adds no interpretation*

The structured clinical record below is the read-only panel the urologist sees up front, exactly as it arrives in this patient's record. The documents it refers to are masked and must be retrieved.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_d49b896a09e6
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 31 Jan 2025.
Referrer: Dr. P. van Dijk (GP).
Type: Re-evaluation - prior PCa diagnosis.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 67-year-old male
  - PSA: 6.7 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 4 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.2 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 1.78 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 4.4 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 36.0 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 1
  - DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: Positive (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.7934635 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Hypercholesterolaemia, Coronary artery disease, Obesity (BMI >30)
  - Problem list / PMHx: Hypercholesterolaemia, Coronary artery disease, Obesity (BMI >30)
  - Current medication: rosuvastatin, aspirin 80 mg, atorvastatin
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 6.7 ng/mL. PI-RADS 4. PSAD 0.20. Prostate volume 36 mL. csPCa 0.79.

Vitals: weight 93 kg, height 178 cm, BMI 29.4, BP 146/77 mmHg, HR 77 bpm. Smoking: Current smoker (17 pack-yr).

Chief complaint: An upward PSA trend alongside a previously positive biopsy necessitates urological review.

History: A widowed retired warehouse worker currently residing with his partner presents for surveillance after a positive biopsy yielded a Gleason 6 diagnosis. His medical background includes coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolaemia, and obesity (BMI >30). Daily medication consists of rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and aspirin 80 mg. He maintains a 17 pack-year smoking history and consumes approximately 19 units of alcohol each week. Despite a consistent running routine covering five kilometres three times weekly, he reports moderate lower urinary tract symptoms scoring 13 on the IPSS scale, absent of significant nocturia or urgency. Cardiology reviewed him in November, confirming stable angina without recent procedures. An unrelated cataract evaluation occurred last month, and he mentions occasional mild fatigue he attributes to seasonal shifts rather than systemic disease. Distance to the hospital exceeds ninety minutes, leading him to prefer telephone consultations when clinically suitable.

Physical examination: DRE — texture: smooth and symmetric; mobility: unremarkable; asymmetry: none. The digital rectal examination confirms a normal prostate without palpable irregularities. General inspection shows a well-nourished individual with a blood pressure reading of 146/77 mmHg and a regular pulse of 77 beats per minute. Palpation of the abdomen reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen free of masses or organomegaly.

Patient info: retired warehouse worker; Widowed; Lives with partner.
Next of kin: Spouse / partner (primary contact).

Lifestyle: alcohol 19 units / week; exercise Running 3x/week, 5 km; IPSS score: 13/35 (moderate LUTS).

Recent other appointments: Ophthalmology — cataract review.
Admin: Lives >90 min from clinic; phone follow-up preferred where clinically safe.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


[Note for the conference: for a task-1 biopsy decision only FOUR masked documents exist on file - the radiology / mpMRI report, the PSA history, the previous notes and the laboratory panel - plus the family-history anamnesis. There is no pathology report to retrieve for this task; the prior-biopsy status in the panel above is all the pathology information on record.]

## [2] STATISTICAL PRIOR (classifier)

**EXPERT-PRIOR** — *statistical expert; bagged classifier over the structured panel, trained on the labelled cohort, out-of-fold honest*

A basic classifier, whose sole purpose is to provide a suggestion, produces this result along with its associated uncertainty. The purpose of this decision is to use it as an initial reference point for discussing the results.

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY
  p(biopsy = yes) = 0.76 +/- 0.14   (95% CI 0.49-1.00)

Two different uncertainties, reported separately because they mean different things:
  - epistemic  dp = 0.14  — the error bar on this number. It is the spread
    across bootstrap members: how much the answer would move with a different training sample.
  - aleatoric  H  = 0.79 of 1.00 — how mixed the outcome was among
    patients this model cannot tell apart. High H means the disagreement is in the data, not in
    the model, and more labelled cases would not fix it.

TIER 'supports': p +/- dp does not cross 0.5 but p +/- 1.96*dp does. A direction, not a conclusion; a weighted vote. Measured accuracy in this tier on the labelled cohort: 0.8 over 20 cases.

Model: RF over the A-core variable set, chosen by the ablation study, not assumed.
Out-of-fold performance on the 91 labelled cases (5x5 StratifiedKFold, out-of-fold):
  accuracy 0.714 (majority-class baseline 0.615), AUC 0.789, F1(yes) 0.78.
Variables it could not read for this patient: none.

It has read ONLY the structured panel and the parsed record. It has not reasoned about the
prose of the mpMRI report, and it does not know what this patient's management plan is.

## [3] GUIDELINE CRITERION FOR THIS SITUATION

**EXPERT-PROTOCOL** — *protocol expert; applies the guideline criterion for this patient's clinical situation*

CLINICAL SITUATION: prior positive biopsy.

THIS CRITERION RETURNS NO ANSWER FOR THIS PATIENT.

The criterion: The visible panel does NOT determine this decision. The patient already has a tissue diagnosis, so neither a high PI-RADS nor a rising PSA is new information. The decision must come from the retrieved documents: whether the prior grade is documented, whether the lesion changed against a previous MRI, whether a surveillance re-biopsy is due, and whether treatment is already agreed.

Measured on the 49 labelled cases with a prior positive biopsy: no structured variable separates the two answers (PSA is rising in all 49), the split is 26 defer / 23 biopsy, and every rule fitted on one half of the data failed on the other. This is genuinely undetermined by the panel.

Do not read this as 'defer' and do not read it as 'biopsy'. It means the panel cannot settle the case and the retrieved documents must.

Like the statistical prior, this expert has read ONLY the visible panel. It has not seen the
mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the previous notes or the laboratory panel.

## [4] IMAGE-EMBEDDING PREDICTOR

**EXPERT-IMAGE** — *image-embedding expert; frozen foundation-model MRI vectors behind a trained head*

Frozen foundation-model embeddings on file for this patient: MRI image (1 vector).
The raw vectors are never shown; only a compact score would be.

No calibrated head is deployed for the biopsy decision, so no score was produced. The probe that measured this modality for task 1 reported AUC 0.43 (at or below chance), which is why nothing is being asserted here.

Bottom line for the chair: the image-embedding route contributes NO usable evidence for this
biopsy decision. Decide on the structured panel, the retrieved documents and the guidelines.
Do not cite imaging-embedding support in the reasoning, and do not let the absence of a score
count as a negative finding.

## [5] AGENDA (round 1)

**MODERATOR** — *moderator; owns the agenda and decides whether the conference may close*

AGENDA FOR ROUND 1. These are the documents this case needs opened, and the question each one must answer. Open these and nothing else unless a named question requires it.

  - radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Does the current mpMRI lesion size/zone compare against an earlier study?
  - psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> What is the serial PSA trend beyond the headline value?
  - previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and patient agreement?

This case hinges on the retrieved documents to determine if the prior positive biopsy status, combined with the current PSA trend and imaging findings, warrants a re-biopsy or surveillance decision. Agenda capped at 3 documents; dropped laboratory_results.

## [6] GAPS AND DOUBTS (round 1)

**LLM-1-GAP-ANALYST** — *raises doubt only; has no access to clinical documents and issues no recommendation*

WHAT THE PRIOR CANNOT SEE
The statistical prior only weighed the structured panel, which includes PSA (6.7 ng/mL), PI-RADS 4, prior positive biopsy, and csPCa probability (0.7934635). It cannot account for the context of the rising PSA velocity (1.78 ng/mL/yr), the patient's significant comorbidities (CAD, Obesity, smoking), or the specific findings from the retrieved mpMRI report or previous notes regarding lesion stability or prior biopsy grade.

WHY THE SUGGESTION COULD BE WRONG
The prior suggests biopsy (p=0.76), but the guideline criterion states the panel is undetermined. This suggests the prior is over-relying on the high csPCa probability (0.79) and the PI-RADS 4 score, potentially ignoring the context that the prior biopsy was positive, which changes the question from "does he have cancer" to "is the lesion progressing/new." The high aleatoric uncertainty (H=0.79) indicates the data itself is highly mixed, meaning the model cannot resolve the ambiguity inherent in the prior positive biopsy status versus the current imaging/PSA trend.

WHAT TO RETRIEVE, AND WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE ANSWER
radiology report - Does the current mpMRI lesion size/zone compare against an earlier study?
psa_trend - What is the serial PSA trend beyond the headline value?
previous_notes - What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and patient agreement?
previous_notes - What was the prior grade, surveillance pathway, and patient agreement?

GUIDELINE ANCHOR
The guideline states that the decision must come from retrieved documents to determine if a surveillance re-biopsy is due, given the prior positive biopsy status.

## [7] EVIDENCE REPORT (round 1)

**LLM-2-EVIDENCE** — *the only participant who retrieved documents; reports findings, not verdicts*

RETRIEVED
get_mri_report
UMCG Groningen | 28 January 2025 | mpMRI prostate
The mpMRI report identifies a PI-RADS 4 lesion in the left peripheral zone, mid-gland, measuring approximately 12 x 8 mm. It notes no seminal vesicle invasion or extraprostatic extension.

get_psa_trend
The serial PSA trend shows values: Oct 2023: 3.0 ng/mL, Mar 2024: 3.9 ng/mL, Aug 2024: 5.1 ng/mL, Jan 2025: 6.7 ng/mL. This indicates a clear upward trajectory.

get_previous_notes
The previous notes document a referral on 03 Oct 2024 due to a rising PSA (to 4.4 ng/mL) and a history of a positive biopsy. The notes do not explicitly state the prior biopsy grade, but confirm a surveillance pathway was initiated.

NOT RETRIEVED
The laboratory results were deliberately left closed because the moderator's agenda did not require them, and retrieving them would not resolve the ambiguity regarding the prior biopsy grade or surveillance protocol status.

WHAT THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now:
- PSA trend: Clear upward trajectory (3.0 $\rightarrow$ 6.7 ng/mL over ~1 year).
- MRI finding: A PI-RADS 4 lesion is identified, which is a new structural finding to assess progression.

AGAINST sampling this patient now:
- Prior biopsy grade: Unknown (The previous notes do not document the ISUP grade or Gleason score).
- Surveillance status: The previous notes confirm a referral but do not explicitly state if an active surveillance protocol is currently in place or if a re-biopsy is due.

WHERE THIS LEANS
The evidence strongly supports further investigation due to the clear rising PSA trend and the identification of a PI-RADS 4 lesion on the latest MRI. This leans towards a biopsy to characterize the lesion progression.
LEAN: biopsy

[Opened in this round: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes. Open on the board so far: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes.]

## [8] CLOSING CHECK (round 1)

**MODERATOR** — *moderator; owns the agenda and decides whether the conference may close*

THE CONFERENCE MAY CLOSE.

Positions on the table: prior=yes, protocol=abstains, evidence=yes.
Consensus: yes — unanimous among those who took a position.
Agenda: requested ['radiology_report', 'psa_trend', 'previous_notes']; opened ['radiology_report', 'psa_trend', 'previous_notes']; still missing nothing.

The retrieved evidence strongly supports further investigation (biopsy) based on the rising PSA trend and the new PI-RADS 4 lesion. However, the prior biopsy grade remains unknown, which is a key missing piece for a definitive protocol decision.

The chair decides on the record as it stands.

## [9] FINAL DECISION AND FORM

**LLM-3-CHAIR** — *chairs the conference; the only participant who decides*

FINAL DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

The decision to proceed with biopsy is driven by the clear upward PSA trend (3.0 to 6.7 ng/mL) and the identification of a PI-RADS 4 lesion on the latest MRI. Although the prior biopsy grade is unknown, the evidence strongly supports further investigation because the retrieved documents show a clear progression of the disease. The statistical prior, which suggested biopsy, is confirmed by the retrieved evidence, leading to a clear consensus.
