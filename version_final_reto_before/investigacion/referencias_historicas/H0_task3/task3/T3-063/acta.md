Postoperative prognosis depends on the preoperative PSA and the prostatectomy findings. Extraprostatic extension is documented. Positive surgical margins is documented. Seminal vesicle invasion is reported absent. Lymphovascular invasion is reported absent. Postoperative PSA and its subsequent trajectory are needed to refine this prognosis; a future recurrence date cannot be established from surgical risk factors alone. The fixed estimated horizon is 28.44 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 22.75–34.13 months; its coverage has not been validated.
