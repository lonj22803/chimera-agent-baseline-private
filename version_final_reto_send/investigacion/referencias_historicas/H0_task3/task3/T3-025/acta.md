The prognosis is influenced by several documented factors. Preoperative factors include a high preoperative PSA of 12. The surgical findings indicate a Gleason 4+3 with ISUP grade group 3, pT3b stage, positive surgical margins, and invasion of the seminal vesicles. The absence of lymph node metastasis is a favorable finding.

Countervailing factors include the documented positive surgical margins and seminal vesicle invasion. The nodal status is documented as no lymph node metastasis. The difference between the single biopsy and the prostatectomy specimen regarding Gleason pattern and ISUP grade is noted as missing, which widens uncertainty.

Postoperative PSA and its trajectory are critical unknowns that would significantly revise this prognosis. Missing postoperative PSA measurements and subsequent follow-up data prevent a definitive assessment of recurrence risk. The current heuristic horizon suggests a range for recurrence. The fixed estimated horizon is 34.46 months. This is a predicted recurrence horizon, not evidence of observed recurrence. The sensitivity range is 27.57–41.35 months; its coverage has not been validated.
