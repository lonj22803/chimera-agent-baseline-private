## Intervención 2 — INTAKE

*the record clerk; reads the file out loud and interprets nothing* · vuelta 1

And this is the same record as the reading form presents it — the panel the urologist sees up front, with the masked documents named but not shown.

You are a senior urologist reviewing a patient case. The structured clinical
record below is shown to you up front, exactly as in the reading form. Some
documents are not shown and must be pulled up via the available tools
(radiology / MRI report, pathology report, previous notes, laboratory
results, PSA history, and the family-history anamnesis) when you need to
consult them.

Case ID: PT-pseudo_1185f6a68df0
Task: 1

Encounter: Urology - outpatient on 22 Feb 2025.
Referrer: Dr. P. van Dijk (GP).
Type: Follow-up - PSA + MRI.

Clinical data (read-only — values loaded from the record):
  - 63-year-old male
  - PSA: 7.0 ng/mL
  - mpMRI — PI-RADS score: 5 (1–2 low · 3 equivocal · 4–5 high risk)
  - PSA density: 0.329 ng/mL²
  - PSA velocity: 1.09 ng/mL/yr
  - Prior PSA: 5.5 ng/mL
  - Prostate volume: 21.27 mL
  - Months since last PSA: 2
  - DRE findings: Normal (Normal · Nodus · Benign · Suspicious · Abnormal · Negative · Not done)
  - Prior biopsy: None (None · Negative · ASAP/HGPIN · Positive)
  - csPCa predicted probability: 0.8321669 (clinically significant PCa = ISUP ≥ 2)

Medical history & medication:
  - Medical history: Atrial fibrillation
  - Problem list / PMHx: Atrial fibrillation
  - Current medication: apixaban, metoprolol
  - Allergies: NKA
  - Additional notes: PSA 7 ng/mL. PI-RADS 5. PSAD 0.33. Prostate volume 21 mL. csPCa 0.83.

Vitals: weight 101 kg, height 179 cm, BMI 31.5, BP 100/66 mmHg, HR 72 bpm. Smoking: Ex-smoker (22 pack-yr, quit 2021).

Chief complaint: Escalating prostate-specific antigen measurements across a two-year span prompted a recent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging study.

History: At sixty-three years of age, this retired mechanical engineer first entered clinical evaluation in early 2023 due to a PSA elevation, which has since steadily ascended to 7.0 ng/mL. His urological documentation indicates a prior biopsy bucket of None. Lower urinary tract complaints remain minimal, characterized by slight hesitancy and a modest increase in nocturia, yielding an IPSS score of 7. He explicitly denies hematuria or pelvic discomfort. Physical activity persists through cycling roughly 30 kilometres three times weekly, although advancing joint stiffness necessitates a walking frame for extended distances. He shares his home with his wife, while their grown daughter handles administrative correspondence. His clinical background includes atrial fibrillation, managed with apixaban and metoprolol. A substantial smoking history of 22 pack-years was successfully abandoned in 2021. Aside from receiving a standard influenza vaccination last week and maintaining stable blood pressure readings, he reports feeling generally well, with no complaints of unexplained fatigue or weight reduction.

Physical examination: DRE — texture: smooth and uniformly firm; mobility: unrestricted; asymmetry: absent. General inspection reveals a well-nourished individual in no acute distress. Vital signs demonstrate a regular heart rate of 72 beats per minute alongside a blood pressure of 100/66 mmHg. Peripheral pulses remain palpable, and there is no clinical evidence of peripheral oedema or lymphadenopathy.

Patient info: retired mechanical engineer; Married; Lives with partner.
Next of kin: Adult daughter (primary contact).

Lifestyle: alcohol 5 units / week; exercise Cycling 3x/week, ~30 km; IPSS score: 7/35 (mild LUTS).

Recent other appointments: GP practice nurse — flu vaccination.
Admin: Mobility limitation (frame); ground-floor consult room preferred.

Information you can request via tools (the masked "Extended EHR view" — what
the urologist would actively pull up during the consult):
  - radiology / MRI report (full mpMRI prose behind the headline imaging values)
  - pathology report (any prior biopsy on record)
  - previous GP / urology consultation notes
  - laboratory results (full panel)
  - PSA history (trend / velocity beyond the headline value)
  - family history of prostate cancer (anamnesis)

Question:
Based on this patient's data, do you recommend biopsy?


One correction to that last paragraph before anybody acts on it: the documents this task actually serves are radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes, laboratory_results, plus the family-history anamnesis. There is NO pathology report to pull up in a task-1 biopsy decision — the prior-biopsy status on the panel above is all the pathology on record, and whatever the previous notes say about it. Nobody should ask for one, and nobody should quote one.

## Intervención 3 — EXPERT-STRUCTURED

*Expert 1, Extra-Trees on the structured panel only; opening bid with an error bar* · vuelta 1

Expert 1 here — the classifier that reads the structured panel and nothing else. My bid:

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.88
  uncertainty  +/- 0.06 epistemic (95% band 0.77-0.99); among patients I cannot tell apart the outcome was 0.54 of 1.00 mixed
  reliability  HIGH ('firm' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 88% of the time over the 33 labelled cases in this tier

VARIABLES I WEIGHED — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (panel only; the levels are what moved my prediction across the series, not what a urologist would mark)
  decisive   prior biopsy = None (43% of my signal; from bx_positive, bx_none)
  important  comorbidity = 1 on the problem list (21% of my signal; from pmhx_hypercholesterolaemia, n_comorbidities)
  noted      age = 63 (2% of my signal; from age) · DRE = Normal (10% of my signal; from dre_suspicious) · PSA = 7 ng/mL (3% of my signal; from log_psa, psav) · prostate volume = 21.27 mL (1% of my signal; from log_vol, vol) · PSA density = 0.329 (0% of my signal; from psad_calc, log_psad) · csPCa probability = 0.83 (1% of my signal; from cspca) · PI-RADS = 5 (20% of my signal; from pirads_ge4, pirads_ge3)
  not used   family history
CONFIDENCE: clear — 'firm' tier; out-of-fold it was right 88% of the time over the 33 labelled cases in this tier

I read 39 raw variables, all from the panel — nothing from the mpMRI prose, the PSA
trajectory, the previous notes or the laboratory. Out-of-fold over 91 labelled cases: AUC
0.758, balanced accuracy 0.625.
The final call is the chair's.

## Intervención 4 — EXPERT-COHORT

*cohort criterion; what the labelled series did in this exact situation* · vuelta 1

This patient's situation: never biopsied. My criterion answers BIOPSY.

The criterion: sample when the mpMRI shows a PI-RADS 3 or higher lesion; defer at PI-RADS 1-2. In the labelled series this criterion matched the reading urologist in 24 of 24 cases in exactly this situation.

Like Expert 1, I have read ONLY the visible panel — not the mpMRI prose, the PSA trajectory, the
previous notes or the laboratory panel. Departing from me needs a specific finding from a document
somebody actually opened, named out loud; not a restatement of the panel numbers I already used.

VARIABLES I WEIGHED — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (panel only; 'decisive' marks the variable the rule turns on)
  decisive   PI-RADS = 5
  important  prior biopsy = None
  noted      age = 63 · DRE = Normal · PSA = 7 ng/mL · prostate volume = 21.27 mL · PSA density = 0.329 · comorbidity = 1 on the problem list
  not used   family history, csPCa probability
CONFIDENCE: clear — the rule matched the reading urologist in 24 of 24 labelled cases

## Intervención 5 — EXPERT-LIBRARY

*case library; the closest labelled precedents and what the reading urologist did with them* · vuelta 1

The case library holds 23 labelled men in this same situation (None prior biopsy). The 3 closest by panel distance, and what the reading urologist did:
  1. distance 0.49: PI-RADS 5, PSA 9.0, PSAD 0.409, age 65, DRE Normal -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "P5 in a man with high PSA"
  2. distance 0.79: PI-RADS 5, PSA 5.9, PSAD 0.199, age 60, DRE Normal -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "PIRADS 5 in a 60 year old man"
  3. distance 1.21: PI-RADS 5, PSA 5.5, PSAD 0.136, age 61, DRE Normal -> BIOPSY (clear). He wrote: "Biopsy naive PIRADS 5 needs biopsy"

PRECEDENT: BIOPSY (weighted vote 1.00 for biopsy). Distance-weighted precedent is strong here (0.92 leave-one-out).

What the precedents are FOR: they show what this urologist looks at and how he phrases the call. What they are NOT: facts about this patient. Nobody may cite a precedent's grade, PSA or MRI as if it were his.

WHAT THE READING UROLOGIST WEIGHED IN THESE PRECEDENTS — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (weighted majority of the 3 nearest labelled traces; the distance itself is on PI-RADS, prior biopsy first)
  decisive   PI-RADS = 5
  important  age = 63 · PSA = 7 ng/mL
  noted      prior biopsy = None · DRE = Normal · prostate volume = 21.27 mL · PSA density = 0.329 · comorbidity = 1 on the problem list
  not used   family history, csPCa probability
CONFIDENCE: clear — the precedents agree (1.00) and the library is right 92% of the time in this situation out of fold

## Intervención 6 — EXPERT-TRACE

*Expert 4, trace model; which documents the reading urologist opens and what he weighs in this situation* · vuelta 1

Expert 4 here — the model of how the reading urologist works a case like this. Predicted from his 23 labelled traces in this situation (None prior biopsy): a per-field model where it beats the mode out of fold (prior-biopsy weight, DRE weight, PI-RADS weight, and whether he opens the laboratory), the mode elsewhere.

WHAT HE OPENS: radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes.

WHAT HE WEIGHS — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (these are the levels that go on the form, unless a colleague shows a reason to move one)
  decisive   PI-RADS = 5
  important  age = 63 · PSA = 7 ng/mL
  noted      prior biopsy = None · family history = not opened (0 of 91) · DRE = Normal · prostate volume = 21.27 mL · PSA density = 0.329 · comorbidity = 1 on the problem list
  not used   csPCa probability
CONFIDENCE: clear — the level the reading urologist records in this situation, from his labelled traces

MODERATOR: that list of documents is the plan — exactly those, no more. Every document opened beyond what
he would open is scored against the conference as an unnecessary reveal; every document left closed
leaves a variable he weighed without its source. Attach the question each one must answer.

## Intervención 7 — EXPERT-EAU

*EAU guideline specialist; speaks only from the guideline text he retrieved* · vuelta 1

GUIDELINE
The EAU guidelines state that a PI-RADS score of 3 or higher is used to trigger a biopsy. "a PI-RADS threshold of $\ge 3$ is used to trigger biopsy [135, 226, 264, 375]." This requires a biopsy for this patient given his PI-RADS 5 score.

WHAT THE EXPERTS' BIDS DO NOT SETTLE
EXPERT-STRUCTURED, I note that the guideline treats the PI-RADS score as the primary trigger, whereas EXPERT-STRUCTURED marked prior biopsy = None as decisive. The guideline makes the prior biopsy status context, but the guideline requires the PI-RADS score to be $\ge 3$ to trigger the decision. The guideline requires the PI-RADS score to be $\ge 3$ to trigger the decision. The guideline needs the prior grade to be established to determine if the decision should be treatment or more tissue.

WHAT THE DOCUMENTS MUST SETTLE
previous_notes - the prior biopsy: at None the guideline suggests a biopsy is indicated based on the PI-RADS 5 score.
radiology_report - whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study: unchanged does not support re-sampling, new or larger does
psa_trend - the PSA trend: the guideline does not explicitly state what the PSA trend means in this context for the biopsy decision.
laboratory_results - the laboratory results: the guideline does not explicitly state what the PSA density means in this context for the biopsy decision.
family-history anamnesis - the family history anamnesis: the guideline does not explicitly state what the family history anamnesis means in this context for the biopsy decision.

## Intervención 8 — MODERATOR

*chairs the discussion; sets the open questions and assigns the documents* · vuelta 1

The case strongly points towards a biopsy based on the PI-RADS 5 score and the expert consensus, but we need clarification on the previous biopsy status and the implications of the PSA trend.

The documents for this session were fixed by EXPERT-TRACE; what I add is the question each one has to answer, and the open questions for the room.

REGISTRAR — pull these up, and answer exactly the question attached to each:
  radiology_report (get_mri_report) -> Must state whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study.
  psa_trend (get_psa_trend) -> Must clarify what the PSA trend means in this context for the biopsy decision.
  previous_notes (get_previous_notes) -> Must detail the prior biopsy status, biopsy sessions, and surveillance protocol.

OPEN QUESTIONS for this conference — these are what the decision hangs on:
  Q1. What must the previous_notes answer regarding the prior biopsy status, the number and dates of biopsy sessions, and whether a surveillance protocol is in place?
  Q2. What must the radiology_report answer regarding whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study?

## Intervención 9 — REGISTRAR

*the registrar who pulls up documents; reports what they say, nothing else* · vuelta 1

WHAT I FOUND
radiology_report: The lesion is compared against an earlier study: new.
psa_trend: The PSA trend shows a rise from 1.3 ng/mL (Mar 2023) to 7.0 ng/mL (Feb 2025), indicating a significant upward trajectory.
previous_notes: Prior biopsy: None. Biopsy sessions: not recorded. Surveillance: not recorded.

WHAT I DID NOT OPEN
family-history anamnesis, because the EAU guideline specialist noted it did not explicitly state what it means in this context for the biopsy decision.

WHAT THIS SUPPORTS
FOR sampling this patient now:
PI-RADS 5 score from the mpMRI, which is a primary trigger according to the EAU guideline.
PSA trend showing a significant rise from 1.3 ng/mL to 7.0 ng/mL.
Prior biopsy status being None, which aligns with the expert-structured and cohort criteria.

AGAINST sampling this patient now:
nothing

WHERE THIS LEANS
LEAN: biopsy

## Intervención 10 — EXPERT-PSA

*Expert 2, PSA projector; the trajectory behind the headline PSA, with a conformal band* · vuelta 1

Expert 2 here — the PSA projector. I read only the serial PSA the registrar opened.

TRAJECTORY: RISING (borderline). Last value 7.00 ng/mL over 3 points spanning 23 months; velocity +2.99 ng/mL per year; doubling time about 9 months.
PROJECTION at 6 months: 10.0 ng/mL, conformal 95% band 2.9-34.8.

Read the band before the point: it is wide by construction, and I only call a direction when the whole
band clears the last value. This does not vote on the biopsy — a rising PSA in a man with a known
diagnosis is the disease behaving as known — it tells the chair how fast the number is moving.

VARIABLES I WEIGHED — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (the serial PSA only)
  noted      PSA = 7 ng/mL
  not used   prior biopsy, family history, age, DRE, prostate volume, PSA density, csPCa probability, PI-RADS, comorbidity
CONFIDENCE: borderline — the conformal band does not clear the last value

## Intervención 11 — EXPERT-FUSION

*Expert 3, Extra-Trees on panel + laboratory + MRI prose; speaks only on documents that were opened* · vuelta 1

Expert 3 here — the fusion classifier. I read the panel, the mpMRI report — the laboratory panel was not opened, so that block is imputed and my band is wider for it; nothing from the previous notes or the PSA series.

SUGGESTION: BIOPSY   p(biopsy) = 0.86
  uncertainty  +/- 0.05 epistemic (95% band 0.76-0.96), of which 0.01 comes from values that had to be imputed
  reliability  HIGH ('firm' tier) — out-of-fold it was right 89% of the time over the 37 labelled cases in this tier

VARIABLES I WEIGHED — in the form's vocabulary, with this man's values (panel + the documents that were opened; PI-RADS here means the report's own wording — DWI restriction, lesion size — not the score)
  decisive   prior biopsy = None (43% of my signal; from bx_positive, bx_none)
  important  PI-RADS = 5 (22% of my signal; from rad_dwi_restriction, rad_lesion_ge15mm)
  noted      PSA = 7 ng/mL (21% of my signal; from fpsa_lt15, psa_delta_prev) · prostate volume = 21.27 mL (4% of my signal; from log_vol, vol) · PSA density = 0.329 (0% of my signal; from psad_calc) · comorbidity = 1 on the problem list (4% of my signal; from n_comorbidities, on_alpha_blocker)
  not used   family history, age, DRE, csPCa probability
CONFIDENCE: clear — 'firm' tier; out-of-fold it was right 89% of the time over the 37 labelled cases in this tier

Out-of-fold AUC 0.794. I am the only expert that has read the report's
wording, and I still cannot see the prior grade or the surveillance history: those are in the notes, and
the registrar has to carry them.

## Intervención 12 — PANEL-PROTOCOL

*the panel's written protocol; consolidates the experts by rule and says which rule fired* · vuelta 1

The panel protocol, applied to what is on the board:

  EXPERT-STRUCTURED  BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.88  ('firm' tier; weight 3.0)
  EXPERT-FUSION      BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=0.86  ('firm' tier, fusion_nolab; weight 4.5)
  EXPERT-LIBRARY     BIOPSY, p(biopsy)=1.00  (k=3 precedents; does not vote)
  EXPERT-COHORT      BIOPSY  (rule pirads_ge_3; does not vote)

  documented prior grade in the opened documents: none recorded

RULE THAT FIRED: cohort criterion (pirads_ge_3) — carried by EXPERT-COHORT.
PANEL ANSWER: BIOPSY. It matched the reading urologist in 24 of 24 labelled cases in exactly this situation (never biopsied).

Confidence to record: clear.

CHAIR: this is the panel's position. You sign it, and you write why in the room's words — naming what the registrar retrieved. If you believe a retrieved finding overturns it, name that finding with its value; the burden is on the finding, not on the panel.

## Intervención 13 — VERIFIER

*second EAU reader; checks against the guideline whether this can be decided yet* · vuelta 1

SUFFICIENCY
The documents the registrar opened (radiology_report, psa_trend, previous_notes) have answered the moderator's questions. The `previous_notes` detailed the prior biopsy status as "None" and noted that biopsy sessions and surveillance were not recorded. The `radiology_report` stated that the lesion is "new" compared to an earlier study.

ALIGNMENT WITH THE PANEL
The retrieved evidence aligns with the PANEL-PROTOCOL's answer of BIOPSY. Specifically, the registrar's finding that the lesion is "new" supports the need for intervention, and the `previous_notes` confirming "Prior biopsy: None" aligns with the criteria used by the EXPERT-STRUCTURED and EXPERT-COHORT.

THE OPEN QUESTIONS, ONE BY ONE
Q1. What must the previous_notes answer regarding the prior biopsy status, the number and dates of biopsy sessions, and whether a surveillance protocol is in place? The `previous_notes` answered this by stating "Prior biopsy: None. Biopsy sessions: not recorded. Surveillance: not recorded."
Q2. What must the radiology_report answer regarding whether the lesion is compared against an earlier study? The `radiology_report` answered this by stating: "The lesion is compared against an earlier study: new."

WHAT CARRIES WEIGHT, AND WHY
<pirads>: 5: decisive because the EXPERT-COHORT rule fired based on PI-RADS $\ge 3$, which is the primary trigger according to the EAU guideline. I agree with the PANEL-PROTOCOL's decision based on this decisive factor.
<prior biopsy>: None: decisive because this variable was marked as decisive by EXPERT-STRUCTURED and EXPERT-COHORT, strongly supporting the biopsy recommendation.
<psa>: important because the PSA trend shows a significant rise from 1.3 ng/mL to 7.0 ng/mL, which supports the need for further investigation.
My confidence in the record as it stands is clear, as the key variables supporting the panel's decision (PI-RADS 5 and no prior biopsy) were confirmed by the retrieved documents.

MY SUGGESTION TO THE CHAIR
I suggest proceeding with a biopsy, as the evidence retrieved confirms the PI-RADS 5 score and the lack of prior biopsy, which aligns with the EAU guideline trigger.

VERDICT: ready | SUGGEST: biopsy | MISSING: none

[The conference closes after pass 1: the verifier called the record ready. The chair decides on the record as it stands.]

MY DECISION: BIOPSY   (confidence: clear)

63y/o, PSA 7.0, PSAD 0.329, biopsy-naive, PI-RADS 5. PI-RADS 5 mandates biopsy, and the rising PSA trend supports sampling. No prior pathology to reconcile this finding.
