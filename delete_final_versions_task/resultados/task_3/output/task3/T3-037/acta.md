The prognosis is influenced by several factors, including a preoperative PSA of 8.8 and positive surgical margins. The pathological findings show Gleason 3+4 (ISUP grade group 2) with no extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion was absent. A notable finding is the presence of lymphovascular invasion. Uncertainty regarding nodal status exists as no lymph nodes were removed, meaning pNx is not equivalent to pN0. Biopsy-to-prostatectomy differences are noted because the biopsy Gleason pattern and ISUP report are missing.

The prognosis could be significantly revised by obtaining postoperative PSA levels and tracking their subsequent trajectory. Further information regarding nodal sampling would also refine risk stratification. The current data suggests a moderate risk profile given the combination of positive margins and LVI, despite favorable seminal vesicle status. The fixed estimated horizon is 62.79 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 37.67–87.91 months; its coverage has not been validated.
