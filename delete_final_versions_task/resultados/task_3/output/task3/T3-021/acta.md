The prognosis is influenced by several factors, including the preoperative PSA of 6.9 and a surgical grade of Gleason 3+3 (ISUP group 1). Countervailing findings include the absence of extraprostatic extension, no seminal vesicle invasion, and negative lymphovascular invasion. A significant limitation is that no lymph nodes were removed, meaning nodal status cannot be assessed. Furthermore, positive surgical margins are noted. The biopsy-to-prostatectomy comparison shows concordance in Gleason grade (3+3/ISUP 1). Missing postoperative PSA data prevents a more refined risk assessment of the current clinical picture. Future prognosis revision would depend heavily on subsequent postoperative PSA levels and their trajectory following this initial evaluation. The fixed estimated horizon is 69.39 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 45.11–93.68 months; its coverage has not been validated.
