## Intervención 11 — CHAIR

The prognosis is influenced by several factors, including a preoperative PSA of 11 and an ISUP grade group 2 pathology. Positive prognostic indicators include negative surgical margins, no extraprostatic extension, and no seminal vesicle invasion documented in the prostatectomy specimen. Conversely, the absence of nodal sampling widens uncertainty regarding regional spread. The biopsy-to-prostatectomy findings are consistent, both showing Gleason 3+4 (ISUP grade group 2). Given that no lymph nodes were removed, this limits assessment of nodal status. Future prognosis hinges significantly on postoperative PSA levels and their subsequent trajectory; any available data guiding the expected decline or stability would be crucial for refining risk stratification. The fixed estimated horizon is 69.39 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 45.11–93.68 months; its coverage has not been validated.
