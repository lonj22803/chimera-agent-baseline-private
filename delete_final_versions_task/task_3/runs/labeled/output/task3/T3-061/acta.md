*the senior urologist who signs the decision* · vuelta 1

The prognosis is influenced by several factors, including the preoperative PSA of 5.4 and the surgical pathology revealing a Gleason 3+4 (ISUP grade group 2). Contributing to risk are the presence of extraprostatic extension and positive surgical margins. Conversely, favorable findings include no seminal vesicle invasion and an absence of lymphovascular invasion. The lack of nodal sampling widens uncertainty regarding nodal status as pNx is not equivalent to pN0. Biopsy results showed Gleason 3+4 (ISUP grade group 2) in the right peripheral zone apex, which aligns with the prostatectomy findings. Prognostic assessment would be significantly revised by postoperative PSA levels and their subsequent trajectory. The fixed estimated horizon is 62.79 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 37.67–87.91 months; its coverage has not been validated.
