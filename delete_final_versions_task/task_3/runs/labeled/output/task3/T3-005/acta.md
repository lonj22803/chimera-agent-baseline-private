The prognosis is influenced by several factors, including the preoperative PSA of 3.9 and the pathological findings showing Gleason 3+4 with tertiary pattern 5 (ISUP grade group 2) and pT3a disease. Countervailing findings include no seminal vesicle invasion and an absence of lymph node metastasis. The presence of positive surgical margins and extraprostatic extension are concerning factors. A notable discrepancy exists between the biopsy, which showed Gleason 3+5 (ISUP grade group 4), and the prostatectomy specimen's lower grade grouping. Missing information regarding postoperative PSA trajectory would significantly impact risk stratification. Further follow-up data on PSA levels would be crucial for refining this prognosis. The fixed estimated horizon is 62.79 months. This represents expected follow-up without an event, not a known recurrence date. The sensitivity range is 50.23–75.35 months; its coverage has not been validated.
